This is a large object show that encompasses older object show of mine such as [[AACOS]] and others. Its based of my megarchive manual archives and collections. This show is part of the larger umbrella of ObjectWeb36.

The abbreviation for this show is MWS.

The show that it encompasses is:
- [[AACOS]]
- Some parts of an old part of old ObjectWeb36.

The name Megarchive in both MWS and my megarchive manual collections is a portmanteau of *Mega* and *Archive*.
