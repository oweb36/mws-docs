Dude, CIFS is an absolute danger. He believes that everybody is in danger and suffering, and that he is the hero destined to liberate them (this is so false).

He is suffering the worst problems in mental health history!

Very delusional. He believes in the fact that he needs to liberate. Hallucinating as he sees stuff. Detached from reality as he does not realize everyone is fine, and actually and genuinely believes that his reality is real. Quite obsessive and compulsive with his zeal. Very schizophrenic and psychotic.

Trying to rationalize his reality, it does not help. He is kinda confused, but yeah. Strategizing on how to "liberate" people, and manipulating them in order to "help" them. CIFS is isolated and awkward due to his health and behavior. He also has sympathy for everyone, albeit delusional.

Slow and sudden. He is sleep-bound and very tired. Likes sleeping alot.

## Relations

### [ToshyFEN](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/ToshyFEN/ToshyFEN.md)

CIFS, you need to go to the mental assylum. Even ToshyFEN (the already less sane one) thinks you need to go!

Stop killing us all and get help! You are not the savior!

### [Wheamy](../../Characters/Washing%20Machines/Wheamy.md)

Wheamy won't even dare to go near CIFS for fear of being killed.
