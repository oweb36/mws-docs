# CeRNY

CeRNY is a [character](Characters.md) as a {role} on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).
## Identity

CeRNY is a Midea floor-standing MFGA-55ARFN1 [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). Clearly her name is not from it, but from CRN ([idk where](void:not)).

CeRNY was born in August 18, 2013. She is a cisgender and heterosexual female.

Btw CeRNY is also known for using Mascara. And oh, also very awesome and cool fact: She can skate and play games.

## Personality

> TLDR: Selective mutism. Always kind, and mostly nice. The mother and woman, the heart and the emotional support, of the group and those who needs it.
> TLDR2: Burden her? Face her freaking anxiety meltdown attacks, with a slice of emotional meltdown and panic attacks. This is not anger though.
> TLDR3: When she's pissed, **BEWARE**! It's serious if she ever reaches this point. It's either anger of righteousness against moral failure, or even worse: **The Anger of Desperation.**
> TLDR4: No problem with people's choices (mostly). Feel free to be gay, but don't be evil. For example, don't be a slave owner.
> TLDR5: Both feminine and masculine, but leans towards feminity.
