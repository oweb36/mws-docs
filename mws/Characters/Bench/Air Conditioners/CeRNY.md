# CeRNY

CeRNY is a [character](../../Characters.md) as a backgrounder on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).
## Identity

CeRNY is a Midea floor-standing MFGA-55ARFN1 [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). Clearly her name is not from it, but from CRN ([idk where](void:not)).

CeRNY was born in August 18, 2013. She is a cisgender and heterosexual female.

Btw CeRNY is also known for using Mascara. And oh, also very awesome and cool fact: She can skate and play games. Also CeRNY is canonically someone with Level-1 [ASD](void:Autism-Spectrum-Disorder)

## Personality

> TLDR: Selective mutism. Shy, anxious and skittish. Also a slight anthrophobe.
> TLDR2: Always kind, and mostly nice. The mother and woman, the heart and the emotional support, the mature one, of the group and those who needs it. Also righteous.
> TLDR3: Burden her? Face her freaking anxiety meltdown attacks, with a slice of emotional meltdown and panic attacks. This is not anger though. She is not that stable, but also not that unstable.
> TLDR4: When she's pissed, **BEWARE**! It's serious if she ever reaches this point. It's either anger of righteousness against moral failure, or even worse: **The Anger of Desperation.**
> TLDR5: No problem with people's choices (mostly). Feel free to be gay, but don't be evil. For example, don't be a slave owner.
> TLDR6: Both feminine and masculine, but leans towards feminity.


Btw, she's the mother and the caretaker ig but whatevs.

CeRNY is known to have selective mutism, and also quite shy and skittish. She might clam up if she's in a crowded place, and those other places. Concerts, conventions, and those [`collective group crowd things`](void:wtf-yappatron-babbler) aren't her cup of tea. She in fact, will hide and get away from crowded place. Slightly an [anthrophobe](void:Anthropophobia).

Oh, but she's not just that. CeRNY is also kind, and (mostly) nice. She is the mother and woman, the heart and the emotional support, and ([one](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/GHR.md) of) the mature one. She is there for those who needs it lol, but yeah. Also why mostly for the nice one? Because she is one of those [**`Beware of the Nice Ones`**](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes) people. And yes, this is a part of her real personality.

CeRNY is also notable for being good and righteous. She likes good, and dislikes evil. This is one of her berserk points.

Btw please do not burden or overload her. She may be kind, but not **THAT** exactly stable, and yes CeRNY is also stable and **NOT THAT** [un](ToshyFEN)stable. If you managed to push her past that point, prepare for meltdowns. Not anger meltdowns. Her meltdowns are anxiety attacks with emotional meltdowns and panic attacks. It's not internal or silent either.

She may be nice, but **BEWARE** for you still can piss off and anger her. If you actually managed to piss her until she angery, **BEWARE**! [Explained more here](#Anger). Also her anger is just a part of her personality (she is actually kind).

CeRNY is quite liberal with choices, but please remember to do what is right. Be Gay, its fine. Be a slave owner, and feel her wrath.

She is also both feminine and masculine, but leans more towards feminity.

### Anger

CeRNY is quite difficult to piss off and anger, but she can if you push her hard. Very difficult, but her anger once reached is very hot, unique, and cray-cray. Very serious if she's angry because its out-of-character for her. 

There are two forms of anger:
- Anger against Moral Failure
- **Anger of Desperation**.

The Anger against Moral Failure is when she witnesses someone does something immoral. She has the right for that, cus she likes righteousness. CeRNY here is still stable and controlled. This form of anger is typically [tranquil fury](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury), which means she usually does not reveal her anger out. This form of anger can be sustained safely, for a long time.

The **Anger of Desperation** on the other hand, is way worse. This means that she is really desperate for something, or that this is her anger for the last-stand or last-ditch against something. She is very desperate in this anger, trying to fight against the trigger in a last-ditch effort. This is one of the worst forms of anger for you. CeRNY in this anger is very unstable. She is at her worst in the **Anger of Desperation** for she is desperate. This anger is one of the rawest forms of anger she can feel, and it's not tranquil. This anger cannot be sustained safely for a long time, yet this anger lasts longer than the anger against moral failure.

You can only push her to the **Anger of Desperation** if you force her to take a last-ditch effort, put her in a last-stand, or make her desperate. This is unlike her Anger against Moral Failure, which you can do by doing questionable and evil things like slavery, murder, and all those crimes against [humanity](void:not).

All the anger is not just her true self. Her kind nature is also not a mask. This anger is a part of her true self.

Comparison:

|           | Anger against Moral Failure             | **Anger of Desperation**                      |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Target    | Against moral failure                   | Last-ditch, last-stand, desperation           |
| Power     | Controlled, Tranquil                    | Raw, Extreme, Intense, Overwhelming           |
| Stability | Stable                                  | Unstable                                      |
| Emotions  | Controlled, Focus, Deliberate           | Uncontrolled, Chaotic                         |
| Danger    | Medium                                  | High                                          |
| Duration  | Can be sustained safely for a long time | Unsafe to sustain, yet its usually very long. |

Basically her anger of moral righteousness is her telling you to cut it out, while her **Anger of Desperation** is she breaking. And no, this is a part of her true personality, not an entire personality.

So CeRNY still may be nice, but **BEWARE** for you still can piss off and anger her. If you actually managed to piss her until she angery, **BEWARE**!
