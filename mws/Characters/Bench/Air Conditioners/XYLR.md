XYLR is what you call the EDM-loving goober. 

He really likes his EDM. He might even do some **kewl tryx** with his stubby legs. And he plans to make his own, cus its quite fun. So yeah, he like electronics and their EDM.

Also he's a silly little mongoose. Always up to no good, and doing funny and weird things. And XYLR is very hyperactive, which means he will also run a lot and bring ruckus everywhere he goes. Despite this, he is good-natured, nice, and kind. Just be wary of his tricks. He may be slick about it, or he ain't slick.

Gooberistics Goober. He is a Goober who does Gooberistics. And also a Mongrel.
## Relations

### [GHR](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/GHR.md)

They are not just friends, but a couple! Do not question about the age gap, this is very different. (un)Surprisingly, he would be a competent father.

### [Avxy](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/Avxy.md)

Goobers together. Avxy with XYLR doing gooberistics with a dash of Hyperactive running.

## Trivia

- he's stubby.
	- This is why he can't drive.
- He's goober, but he's not a total joker and a pranker. That title goes to [Avxy](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/Avxy.md).
	- He's also not a jackass stuntman. This goes to [ZeNer](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/ZeNer.md).
