# XKC

XKC is a [character](Characters.md) as a backgrounder on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).
## Identity

XKC is a Panasonic wall-mounted CS-XE12CKE [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is derived from his model (CS-**X**E12**CK**E).

XKC was born in February 6, 2004. He is a **Gay AF** cis-male (he/him). Cyanic.

## Personality

> TLDR: He is friendly and entertaining. You can spend hours just watching him fool around with tomfuckery.
> TLDR2: Uncoordinated fun-loving fool ig.  Thrilling and unrestrained.

Well, XKC is your guy who is pretty much friendly and entertaining. He may not be the daredevil like [ZeNer](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/ZeNer.md) is, but he is very funny to watch. I bet you 17 bucks you can watch him for hours and not be bored even once.

Problem? He ain't coordinated, but he is happy. He may seem old and chill, but he ain't that! He is also extremely thrilling himself, and thrilling to watch. Its mostly just tomfooling and stuff, not the dangerous tricks to get yourself killed. And he is unrestrained in tomfooling.

## Relations

### [DKE](DKE.md)

DKE and XKC are gay together. Boyfriends eh?

XKC has figured out the way to DKE's eccentricity, and DKE is way open to him.

### [Avxy](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/Avxy.md)

They are great pairings! Combine prank and tomfool and you get something unique to watch!

### [ZeNer](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/ZeNer.md)

They are great friends! XKC is the restraint though, monitoring the genderfluid Hi-Tech boy that is ZeNer so he would not die!

XKC tomfucks while ZeNer Jackasses.
