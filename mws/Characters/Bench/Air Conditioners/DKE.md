DKE is your eccentric guy. Does things quite strangely and has an eccentric way of living.

DKE is actually quite nice though if you can communicate with him correctly. Quite friendly and bubbly. His niceness is masked by his eccentric behavior. DKE is also known for masking a lot so he can even interact with people. Very little enemies though.
