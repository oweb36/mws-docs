# TKA

TKA is a background [character](Characters.md) on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).
## Identity

TKA is an LG wall-mounted AS-H246TKA2 (F24AHJ) [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). White skin.

TKA was born in October 26, 2005. He is a cisgender and heterosexual male (he/him) because his personality is not there to understand the complexity of LGBTQ.

Basically the child of MWS who will never and cannot grow up. Due to "brain" and personality ig, AKA a condition or smth.

Best friends with [JKE](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/JKE.md) ig.

## Neurology

One thing is that his [*brain*](void:circuits) is also quite simple like [WELLPan](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/WELLPan.md), actually even simpler. TKA's brain you can say is even smaller than WELLPan's. But still quite efficient, and even more.

TKA's *brain* is also well-documented like WELLPan's, and yes no anger circuits, but sadness is still there. And yes, we know his thinking process.

Soul factor? Still there. Adding randomness.

> I ain't gonna retype all ts read [WELLPan](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/WELLPan.md)'s page for it.

But, TKA has the potential to even be smarter than WELLPan. Too bad TKA is always gonna be immature and childish. The thing still is, TKA would even be smarter than WELLPan if his *neural thing* is scaled and aged up appropriately to WELLPan's state.

## Personality

> TLDR: An adult with a well-mannered child personality. Still behaves like an innocent child, and so not as mature as you think. Always will be a manchild.
> TLDR2: Not mature (repetition). Indulges in childish immaturity.
> TLDR to TLDR: A literal manchild and always be, but nice and not brat.

TKA is simply an adult with a child personality. He is literally an adult who behaves like a well-mannered child. Very innocent ig. Not that mature since TKA literally behaves like a child.

TKA also indulges in childish immaturity. Always does childish things. TKA would literally do the **haha you said X** kind of thing.

> Here is the thing: TKA will always be this. He will always have the mentality of a child. He will never grow up.
## Relations

### [Wheamy](../../Characters/Washing%20Machines/Wheamy.md)

TKA may be an adult, but he is still a child (or at least child-like). Wheamy still treats him as a kid. Yes, Wheamy is protecting a manchild. 

Do not worry! A great manchild unlike those psychopaths.

### [JKE](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/JKE.md)

Best friends ig! They like things together. Its like a chatty guy with a little (man)child!

### [WELLPan](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/WELLPan.md)

These two are kinda the same. Same '*brain*' and yes. But still friends. Can relate. One is lazy-ass, while the other is a child in an adult's body.
