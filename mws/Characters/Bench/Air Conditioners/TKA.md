# TKA

TKA is a background [character](Characters.md) on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).
## Identity

TKA is an LG wall-mounted AS-H246TKA2 (F24AHJ) [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). White skin.

TKA was born in October 26, 2005. He is a cisgender and heterosexual male (he/him) because his personality is not there to understand the complexity of LGBTQ.

Best friends with [JKE](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/JKE.md) ig.

## Personality

> TLDR: An adult with a well-mannered child personality. Still behaves like an innocent child, and so not as mature as you think. Always will be a manchild.
> TLDR to TLDR: A literal manchild and always be, but nice and not brat.

TKA is simply an adult with a child personality. He is literally an adult who behaves like a well-mannered child. Very innocent ig. Not that mature since TKA literally behaves like a child.

Here is the thing: TKA will always be this. He will always have the mentality of a child.
## Relations

### [Wheamy](../../Characters/Washing%20Machines/Wheamy.md)

TKA may be an adult, but he is still a child (or at least child-like). Wheamy still treats him as a kid. Yes, Wheamy is protecting a manchild. 

Do not worry! A great manchild unlike those psychopaths.

### [JKE](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/JKE.md)

Best friends ig! They like things together. Its like a chatty guy with a little (man)child!
