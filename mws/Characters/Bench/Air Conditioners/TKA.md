## Personality

> TLDR: An adult with a well-mannered child personality. Still behaves like an innocent child, and so not as mature as you think. Always will be a manchild.
> TLDR to TLDR: A literal manchild and always be, but nice and not brat.

TKA is simply an adult with a child personality. He is literally an adult who behaves like a well-mannered child. Very innocent ig. Not that mature since TKA literally behaves like a child.

Here is the thing: TKA will always be this. He will always have the mentality of a child.
