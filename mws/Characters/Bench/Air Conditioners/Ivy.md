# Ivy

Ivy is a [character](Characters.md) as a backgrounder on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).
## Identity

Ivy is a an IVT 12PHR-N [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md).

> Ivy is a `Nordic Inverter` version of [JHR](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/AEX/JHR.md). This means that Ivy and JHR looks exactly the same except that JHR is multi-split while Ivy is single-split lol.

Ivy hails from Sweden (She's a Swedish!).

Ivy was born in July 8, 2013. She is a female (she/her).

Also did you know that Ivy is [JHR](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/AEX/JHR.md)'s cousin! They are same, except that Ivy could heat way lower than JHR (**10c**), but is also only single-split.

## Personality

> TLDR: Quite Bossy. No Nonsense. No Fun.
> TLDR2: Basically the embodiment of `white collared long-sleeved dress shirt, with a black tie` woman. Office life basically.
> TLDR3: Efficiency is best. No chaos, always organizing and sorting.

She's the bossy girl running the show or whatever. You cannot do nonsense or get away with fun. She's not fun to work with, and has no fun. You can think of her as the `vegan's tongue` of fun.

Ivy sees efficiency as some of the greatest thing. No chaos, must be neat and organized. In fact, she is always organizing and sorting. Chaos and insanity is kinda her piss-button.

So yeah, she's a great boss and a terrible social friend ig. Good for efficiency, bad for sanity and health.
## Relations

### [Xeo](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/Xeo.md)

Somehow, these two are always fighting if they are put together. One is angry, one is bossy. You know Xeo and Ivy wouldn't mix well.

### [JHR](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/AEX/JHR.md)

Cousins.

Somehow these two get along even if their personalities are different. Probably because they are cousins.

### [ToshyMEF](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/ToshyMEF.md)

Sassy and Workforce, they are not going to do well.

ToshyMEF being rude, is not going to do well with Ivy. Expect a lot of conflicts, so yeah...

### [Xefa](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/Xefa.md)

Obviously they would not get together well.

We know why do you? But lemme explain to the fools. Well, one is a valley girl who is obsessed with her, while the other does not care. Do you think it will clash? Yeah!

Anyways, Ivy would probably abuse and beat the hell out of Xefa if placed together.

### [WELLPan](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/WELLPan.md)

WELLPan is lazy, so Ivy does not like him. Yeah, its obvious. Ivy clearly hates WELLPan because he lazy and chill, the antithesis to Ivy's ideology and philosophy.

### [ToshyMEM](../../Characters/Air%20Conditioners/ToshyMEM.md)

ToshyMEM and Ivy would make a pretty deadly-efficient duo.

This duo should not be underestimated with, and is to be reckoned with. They are very crazy efficient at doing their jobs. Throw them into a competition, and they can wreck others and win the entire thing easily.
