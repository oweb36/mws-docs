REU is a [character](Characters.md) as a background child on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

## Identity

He is a Samsung WD0604REU [washing machine](Washing%20Machines.md). His name is pronounced as Ryu, or R-E-U.

He was born in June 9, 2011. He's an asexual demiboy (he/they).

## Personality

> TLDR: Straightforward Dismissor, and Stable. A mastermind, who is quite silent lol. Manners are average though despite his personality. Does not get angry that much. REU is also quite an ingenious (not on the level of [so](AEX)[me](MHeLy) [people](WELLPan)), but does not have the emotional intelligence to be considerate.

Read the TLDR boi! I ain't explaining all of that! Its good enuf!
