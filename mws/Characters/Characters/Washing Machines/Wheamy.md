# Wheamy

Wheamy is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant guy on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

## Identity
Wheamy is an LG WM2101HW [washing machine](../../Species/Washing%20Machines.md). His name is pronounced as Whim-my.

He was born on December 19, 2009. He is a cisgender and pansexual male (he/him).

Wheamy is not the most intelligent or knolwedgable person in MWS.

## Personality
Wheamy is pretty much caring towards others, and what they need. He usually protects others, typically those younger than him. He may doubt himself though at times, in his abilities to protect or whether he is doing it for real.

Wheamy may also not always be the happiest person. He may lash out at times. This is due to him protecting his dependees from the danger. This danger is what makes him not the happiest, as he hates them to his core.

Wheamy is also a day dreamer. If he has nothing to do, he lets himself day dream and imagine utopia. Everything is happy in his dreams. Its euphoria to him.

Wheamy also is considered a femboy. Wheamy typically acts more feminine than masculine at times (which kinda matches his name). He is not **THAT** flamboyant, but he is obvious at being a femboy. He is still very sissy by man standards. Maybe all of this is why he cares, but idk (You speculate and theorize).

## Relations
### [Idendiby](Idendiby.md)
Wheamy is the guardian for Idendiby. Idendiby is very young, and Wheamy is there to protect him.

### [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md)
Wheamy protects AngelSaph not only because of his young age, but also due to his emotional and physical vulnerability.

### [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG)
Wheamy hates him for making not only his life hell, but burdens him in protecting others. DeltaCXG has harmed others, and potentially everyone. Wheamy doesn't need an extra abuser to deal with.

### [RXe](RXe.md)
Wheamy hates the shit out of RXe. He has to deal with many potential abusers to his dependees. He doesn't need more!

### [Piss](Piss.md)
Wheamy does not inherently hate or dislike him, but is not the happiest with him. Their relations aren't the most harmonious.

Why? Because Piss tries to prevent AngelSaph from eating for safekeeping. While Wheamy understands that Piss is doing it for the good of everyone, he can't just do that while allowing one person who needs food to die!

### [JHR](../Air%20Conditioners/AEX/JHR.md)
JHR shows Wheamy the way to life. He shows him, how to do life skills. Wheamy doesn't exactly know a lot of things in life, so JHR guides him.

Wheamy doesn't protect JHR because JHR can do so himself.

Its pretty good basically with their relationship.

### [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md)
Wheamy doesn't know what to do with ToshyFEN. He has a dillema: help him or hate him. He doesn't know whether he should help and protect ToshyFEN or hate and try to avoid him.

Wheamy feels this way because he knows that ToshyFEN is still young, and in fact younger than him. Wheamy also knows that ToshyFEN needs some help because he is aware of his poor mental health. The other side is that Wheamy knows that ToshyFEN can be unhinged and angry. ToshyFEN might even make his life harder than what he has know.

Wheamy is very confused and worried about ToshyFEN. ToshyFEN to him is a mentally unstable person who needs help. This is because ToshyFEN fits both for Wheamy's need to help him and him making Wheamy's work harder.

### [NAEphthalene](NAEphthalene.md)

Wheamy finds NAEpthalene more pleasant in comparison to [others](VXU.md#DeltaCXG). He is still not happy with him cus sexism? Bro what? To him thats just a low.
