LCN is a gentle, but kinda insecure. Not a protective mother, or an immature one. Just quite shy lol.

She likes to collaborate and work together. Teamworks makes the dreamwork! Friendship Rules! So yeah, she enjoys working with others. (**CONFLICTING with another**)

Also she is usually happy, but this is volatile. Not volatile from happy to anger, but happy to sadness. Its as if she has bipolar disorder, except that the period is way too short for it.
