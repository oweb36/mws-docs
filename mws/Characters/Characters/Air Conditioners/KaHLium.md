KaHLium is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). He originally appeared in [AACOS](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/AACOS.md).

## Identity

KaHLium is a wall-mounted Sharp AH-AP5KHL [air conditioner](Air%20Conditioners.md). He is the 3rd generation in the Sharp Sayonara Panas series, AKA she is the **Sayonara Panas III/Sayonara Panas 3** air conditioner.  
His name is pronounced as Kalium, which is the latin name of Potassium. Yes! His name is a reference to Kalium!

KaHLium was born on September 11, 2009 (Wai r u luking laik dat?). He is a cisgender and heterosexual male (he/him).

If skin color matters, KaHLium is white.

His younger sister is [MHeLy](MHeLy.md).

KaHLium is the second most intelligent person in the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

## Personality

TLDR: Level headed serious guy who wants to be normal. No goofing around on his watch, even his humor is dry (he is aware of his birthday). Observant analyst for gathering intel, but to mainly check on his [sister](MHeLy.md) whom he loves. Has common sense even in the most pressuring situations unlike others.

KaHLium is a level-headed person. He is not that insane, but not that chill. He is your average person. He just wants to be normal, that is it. Please don't make him that unique, he doesn't like that. KaHLium is also a serious person, who doesn't exactly tolerate no-nonsense things. This trait might conflict with others.

KaHLium has pretty dry humour. His humour is deadpan and anti-joke. He does not give emotions normally, especially with his humour. His humour is a representation of his personality. This is probably due to his birthday.

KaHLium being serious means that he is not the one to take jokes lightly. He is also a no-nonsense person, and does not exactly tolerate them well. He just wants to do things the way it is. Follow the instructions kind of person, down to earth kind of person, a realists. This may conflict with some of the nonsense-loving people of MWS.

KaHLium is also a fairly analytical and observant person. He observes his surroundings and checks on MHeLy often. KaHLium is also the kind of person to stalk others to gain intel. He potentially could know your browsing history and group chats.

KaHLium has one trait that most of the others don't in very pressuring situations: Common Sense. If you pit a fight against him in a turn-based combat system, he will dodge your attacks while the others won't.

KaHLium is a big brother to MHeLy. He loves her, and treats her well. They are literally part of the same family tree.

## Relations

### [MHeLy](MHeLy.md)

MHeLy is KaHLium's younger sister. He loves her, and is protective of her. MHeLy motivates and makes KaHLium happy when he's down.

### [Fisios](Fisios.md)
They both are aware that they are down to basic, down to earth and practical. They talk like a normal conversation.

No funny things, but they are efficient when paired together. Due to them being down to basic and practical, they have an extremley high efficiency of work rate in doing work. They do the work and then immediately move on after doing everything needed for the work. No extra work, or incomplete work by them.

### [AEX](AEX.md)
[JHR](AEX.md#JHR) has a love-hate relationship with KaHLium, aka a frenemy situation. 

JHR likes him because he knows that KaHLium is smart. JHR also knows that KaHLium, despite being logical and very intelligent, is miles below JHR. JHR likes to teach KaHLium a lot of things. He gives him knowledge on life and general school knowledge.

JHR also knows that KaHLium is the elder brother to MHeLy. 

JHR dislikes one thing about KaHLium, his no-nonsense nature. He feels like he can't have fun with KaHLium. Why must he be miserable all the time?

Anyways, JHR tends towards the love side more than the hate side of his relationship with KaHLium. Basically JHR is more friends than enemies with KaHLium.

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)
KaHLium asks one question and says one thing to WELLPan: Why, and also you so chill we can be friends.

He is so befuddled at WELLPan's chilness, lack of seriousness, and [**INANGERABILITY**](void:made-up-word-for-cannot-be-angered). Very confusing and mysterious to this dry guy.

Still can chat. He is friends with this guy, despite him actually confusing him.

### [ZSRK](ZSRK.md)
The dry joker and the temper-tantrum throwing detective comes together.

They aren't harmonious. There is quarreling and temper anger outbreak situations, which is not common, but not rare. Those situations are uncommon.

KaHLium doesn't like the anger issues of ZSRK. He is quite blatant on that. ZSRK doesn't accept this idea. This is a vicious cycle and why they are not harmonious when together.

They can work very well though if they have to. ZSRK can fetch and deduce things from crap, while KaHLium does the heavy data crunching. Its like Fisios, but KaHLium is more blunt and blatant.

### [Vista](Vista.md)
KaHLium respects Vista for being logical. He knows that Vista is actually smart at things. Vista can do a lot in logics and logistics.

KaHLium has one thing that makes him quite sad at times, but not sad at times. He wishes that he has Vista's wet humor. KaHLium knows that his humor is dry, and on the contrary Vista's humor is wet.
