# MHR

MHR is a [character](../../../Characters.md) as a member of [AEX](AEX.md) on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).
## Identity

MHR is a Sharp multi wall-mounted AY-XPM18HR [heat pump](../../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as H-R just like how you pronounce the abbreviation of *Human Resources*. His name is derived from the "XPM" and "HR" of his species' model.

MHR was born in March 15, 2008. He's part of the same batch as [EXMGR](EXMGR.md) and [JHR](JHR.md). He's part of the same batch as [JHR](JHR.md) and [EXMGR](EXMGR.md), and therefore have the same birthday.

MHR is the strongest one out of AEX. He has some anger issues, but not as severe as [Xeo](../Xeo.md)'s.
MHR has arms and legs.

MHR is a cisgender male. MHR is unlabelled in sexual orientation as he has no idea if he wants to be gay, bisexual, heterosexual or asexual. He just leaves it unlabelled just for it.

MHR is (supposedly) white if skin color matters. I say supposedly because he is currently yellowed. Its not severely yellowed, and therefore it doesn't bother him. This yellowing shows MHR's age. The cause of this is his body's chemistry and exposure to sunlight. Its kinda a sore thumb, but a proud sore thumb.

## Personality

TLDR: Cold, Aggressive, Introverted. Slightly angry. Good in the inside, but not good on the outside.

MHR is the gruffy boi. He is the strongest one, and therefore has a pretty rough and tough personality. He is not a jock though, he doesn't exercise that much.

He isn't the most welcoming, and is very irritable. MHR is also quite unpleasant to interact with at times. He is also not that emotional, to the point where he doesn't let his emotions appear to others (like sadness cus boys are boys). Basically he is an unpleasant and emotionless person.

MHR might have some anger issues, but its not as bad as [Xeo](../Xeo.md)'s (his anger issues is mild compared to Xeo's). He has a way to deal with them, unlike Xeo lashing out on people. MHR would even punch walls or tables rather than punch somebody. MHR would also try to exercise his anger away (though he doesn't exercise that much). MHR, basically would do whatever he can to avoid taking his anger on somebody.

Despite this, MHR is not arrogant or a bully. He just keeps to himself. MHR also does not like hurting others physically despite him being a gruff boi. MHR would rather be alone and not interact with people rather than interact with others and potentially hurt them (maybe). He can join parties or large-aah people events for extroverts, but he would just be silent.

MHR also has one good side, but it doesn't manifest in a good way. He cares for people, but mostly to AEX. He cares and will protect his siblings (AEX). MHR usually does not do this for others, and even if he does so its mostly a one-time-off thing. Don't expect him to potect you randomly eh!

MHR is basically a gruff introvert. He is good but he ain't nice.

## Relations

#### [VXU](../VXU/VXU.md)
MHR has a love-hate relationship with VXU.

MHR respects [MXU](../VXU/VXU.md#MXU) for attempting to stop [this dumbass](../VXU/VXU.md#DeltaCXG) if he can. MHR though feels at times MXU is incompetent or even slacking off at this responsibility.

MHR has problems with DeltaCXG. He does not like DeltaCXG bullying and harming others. MHR would rip DeltaCXG if he dares hurt [PCR](#PCR). MHR is also that one guy along with ToshyFEN to stop DeltaCXG if needed.

## Trivia

- He's slightly yellowed.
	- This is modeled after my IRL **AH-AP18GMY**.
