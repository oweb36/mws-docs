## Identity

EXMGR is a Sharp AE-XM30GR [outdoor unit](../../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). EXMGR though can support 4 units, is configured to support 3 because of [MHR](MHR.md). 

EXMGR's name is pronounced as:
- E-X-M-G-R
- E-X-Manager (Prefered)
- Ex-Manager
- Ex-M-G-R
His name is derived from the "AE-X" and the "GR" of his species' model.

EXMGR was born in March 15, 2008. He's part of the same batch as [JHR](JHR.md) and therefore have the same birthday.

EXMGR is armless, and only has legs for limbs.

EXMGR is quite hyperactive. He speaks too fast. He is also on par with [JHR](JHR.md) in his intelligence, but his hyperactivity dampens it.

EXMGR is a cisgender and heterosexual male (he/him).

EXMGR is white if skin color matters.

## Personality

TLDR: Crazed, Babbler, Good, Erratic, Happy, Bizarre. Lacking in social skills. Friendly, accepting. Slightly depressed, but not too bad to overpower his happiness.

EXMGR is the most extroverted person in AEX. He is very hyperactive and speaks way too fast. Its pretty hard to discern EXMGR's fast speech thats quite mumbling and slurring (not the offensive slurring). EXMGR has way too much energy in him probably. It's even hard for him to pay attention and focus at one part. He has severe inattention. EXMGR could potentially have ADHD.

Because of all above, his speech is quite impaired. He also has poor social skills due to it.

Despite this, EXMGR is still quite friendly. He would love to make new friends and be your friend. He can yap a lot, and with his rapid speech it can be a nightmare to listen to so please bear with it. If you want to be his friend, he would be happy to befriend you. EXMGR would also be the one to ask you if you want to be his friend.

EXMGR though has some slight sadness within him. This is because despite him wanting to make friends, he finds it hard to make befriend others at times. All of this are due to him speaking too fast and have bad social skills.

EXMGR is a good guy, with bad social skills in a nutshell.

## Relations

### [WELLPan](../WELLPan.md)

[WELLPan](../WELLPan.md) is on good terms with EXMGR along with [PCR](PCR.md).

Sometimes WELLPan sees EXMGR's hyperactive social nature as quite too extreme sometimes, which is very true.
