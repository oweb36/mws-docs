# JHR

JHR is a [character](../../../Characters.md) as a member of [AEX](AEX.md) and the host on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).
## Identity

JHR is a Sharp high-wall AY-XPC12JHR [heat pump](../../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md).  His name is pronounced as Jay-Eitch-Ar and derived from the JHR part of his species as a Sharp AY-XPC12JHR.

JHR is a member and a sibling to [AEX](AEX.md). He is capable of being used in both single-split and multi-split systems, but he is currently in a multi-split system as [AEX](AEX.md).

He was born in March 15, 2008. JHR is a cisgender and bisexual male (he/him).  
If skin color is considered, he is white.

JHR has arms and legs btw.

JHR is considered sociopathic and sadistic. His sadism is not that extreme and it only manifests in his sociopathy. Basically he has *Antisocial Personality Disorder*.

JHR owns a *TRS-80 Model 100* portable computer. He finds it way useful for life and work purposes. The other people to own a *TRS-80 Model 100* is [Vista](../Vista.md). JHR also is one of the most intelligent person in MWS.

## Personality

In a nutshell, he behaves differently in different situations. JHR is still genuinely a good guy though albeit slightly insane (sociopathy or more like just quite cold). He has two personalities to say the least.

> TLDR: Nice, educational. Cold, strict, stern and potentially coarse at times. Slight saddism. Antisocial at times too, but less often and yet still noticeable. Weird kind-of and two-faced at times (basically two personalities). Slightly insane. Believes in open and common knowledge.
#### As a host
Well, he's welcoming. He can be strict and stern, following the rules. He might get overboard, but he won't.

This is basically a part of his two-faced personality.
#### As a normal person
JHR can yap and talk a lot of things. Some of it may be weird and kinda sus when taken out of context. He yaps a lot, and most of which is quite useful info. If you ask him to show you the way by education, he will share and teach you the knowledge. JHR is not as talkative as [JKE](../JKE.md).

He may spew out from his speech some random garbage or like I said, dangerous things (when out of context). Its mostly from his mind, and we know what his mind is based of what he may leak. He does this cus he's slightly insane but ye.

JHR would like to spread his knowledge to others. He believes that knowledge should be everywhere and people should know it. This is why he sometimes teaches people some ways as he believes not only is that knowledge in question useful, but beneficial.

At Times, JHR may be antisocial and cold. He might be indifferent or just dgaf about people's feelings. He might even be slightly saddistic to others. Don't worry, its just rare and he is genuinely good alright. 

JHR might go into this other personality side randomly since he is well slightly insane, but by random is rare. What most likely causes this is JHR being overstressed.

## Relations

#### [MHeLy](../MHeLy.md)
MHeLy is a close friend to JHR, and vice versa. MHeLy has known JHR other for longer compared to anybody else in her. They have enjoyed time together, playing and watching the silver of the night skies.
#### [KaHLium](../KaHLium.md)
JHR has a love-hate relationship with KaHLium, aka a frenemy situation. 

JHR likes him because he knows that KaHLium is smart. JHR also knows that KaHLium, despite being logical and very intelligent, is miles below JHR. JHR likes to teach KaHLium a lot of things. He gives him knowledge on life and general school knowledge.

JHR also knows that KaHLium is the elder brother to MHeLy. 

JHR dislikes one thing about KaHLium, his no-nonsense nature. He feels like he can't have fun with KaHLium. Why must he be miserable all the time?

Anyways, JHR tends towards the love side more than the hate side of his relationship with KaHLium. Basically JHR is more friends than enemies with KaHLium.

### [WELLPan](../WELLPan.md)
They are good friends. JHR and WELLPan likes to read books in their spare time together.

WELLPan is Lazy-ass though. Exercise his-ass.

### [AngelSaph](../AngelSaph.md)
They are actually ok friends. They spend time together, sometimes. AngelSaph is quite wary of JHR's tendency to be sociopathic.

JHR doesn't really understand why AngelSaph needs to cook and eat, not that it matters. He doesn't understand the idea of flesh. AngelSaph is a different breed to him, but they are still friends. AngelSaph's physiology is on a whole another level for JHR to comprehend.

### [Wheamy](../../Washing%20Machines/Wheamy.md)
JHR shows Wheamy the way to life. He shows him, how to do life skills. Wheamy doesn't exactly know a lot of things in life, so JHR guides him.

Wheamy doesn't protect JHR because JHR can do so himself.

Its pretty good basically with their relationship.

### [CKHSC](../CKHSC.md)
They teach each other. They learn from each other about life, and how it changes.

JHR shows CKHSC the way of the modern life. Its the progressive way of living, as CKHSC likes to put it. CKHSC is quite hesistant and resistant to this way, and JHR is aware of it. JHR tries to coax and guide CKHSC to the modern life.

CKHSC shows JHR the way of the traditional life, which would have been lost if it weren't for [CKHSC](../CKHSC.md) and the other elders. CKHSC shows JHR the old ways, that is usually trusted and battle-tested.

With the difference in the generations, JHR and CKHSC knows the progression of life.

### [Vista](../Vista.md)
Vista is friends with [JHR](JHR.md) because of one thing they have in common: A *TRS-80 Model 100*.

They work together programming that ancient tech. Vista is the one to teach JHR because despite JHR being intelligent and able to use computers, he has no idea how to program.

They are still good friends even if you take away their *TRS-80 Model 100*.
