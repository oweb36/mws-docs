# GiSelleY

GiSelleY is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). He originally appeared in [AACOS](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/AACOS.md).


## Identity

She is a wall-mounted Sharp AH-AP12GSY [air conditioner](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). Her name is pronounced Jee-See and her name is derived from the GSY portion of her species. Feel free to shorten her name to GiSY.

Indonesian.

She was born in May 10, 2008. She is a pansexual demigirl (she/they).

If skin color mattered, she is white.

## Personality
> TLDR: Bubbly Optimist, always looking to the bright side of life and cheering up people's hope with (sometimes unrealistic) motivations and dreams (that may annoy others sometimes).  Nurturing, kind and gentle but may fail on sociopaths or just evil people. 
> TLDR2: Tries to prepare you for survival. Easily hurt emotionally, and withdraw as a defense response. Very forgiving and is willing to drop past mistakes such as those emotional harms that causes her to isolate her.

GiSelleY is a bubbly optimist. She always looks to the bright side of life, no matter the conditions. This may be annoying to others who may be realists. GiSelleY is always trying to bring people's hopes and motivations up, even if they are not realistic. She just wants to make people happy you know that right? And yes, she is chatty.

How chatty? Yappatron. She will try to find someone to chat lol. But whatevs.

GiSelleY also is a very kind and gentle demigirl. She's out there to care and nurture others. She may even try to teach and train her fellow friends on how to live, and survive. She also tries to nurture kindness, but that doesn't always works on some [sociopathic or even evil](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) people. 

GiSelleY is bubbly after all eh?

GiSelleY also can get hurt easily emotionally. She's very sensitive due to her nature. If she's hurt, then GiSelleY may recede and withdraw from society. Misunderstanding her is one way to hurt her.

GiSelleY is quite forgiving at least. She will forget any past harm, conflict and insults thrown to her or others. She forgives others and just wants to be friends. She may even forget the harm and others had done to her that causes her to isolate herself, and even forgive the perpetrators. This can be against some of her peers, who are less forgiving much to their frustration.

## Relations

### [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG)

[DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG) is the one who likes to bully GiSelleY. He knows that GiSelleY is sensitive, and he still does it. He just wants to feel her pain. DeltaCXG wants to be a sadist towards this poor soul who just wants to make the world a better place.

A pesk- ```I mean helpful``` fellow sibling of DeltaCXG (or [VXU](VXU.md)), [MXU](#MXU) is the reason why this bullying is not happening everyday. DeltaCXG would actually try to hurt GiSelleY, but MXU has been intervening in all of these cases, much to DeltaCGX's chargin and GiSelleY's ```help me pls idk the vocab pls```. MXU would intervene by walking away.

MXU is not always succesful in intervention though. DeltaCXG has hurt GiSelleY few times. DeltaCXG has said very nasty and demoralizing things to GiSelleY before MXU could intervene by walking away. 

DeltaCXG also has actually assaulted her succesfully, resulting in injuries to GiSelleY. He once punched and struck her so hard, he managed to crack her body. Yeah, DeltaCXG actually hits demigirls, and is a women beater (probably). Not that it matters though.

### [MHeLy](MHeLy.md)

They are good friends. MHeLy and GiSelleY's caring nature pairs them together. They would work together to not only care, but make the world a better place for everyone.

They are very happy together. They aren't a couple though. MHeLy is not a lesbian or LGBTQ in nature alright?

### [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md)

AngelSaph and GiSelleY are life partners. Not romantic partners, nor sexual partners.

They always are there for each other when they need them. You know GiSelleY is there when AngelSaph really needs her, and vice-versa. They are similar, but `delta modus operandi`.

GiSelleY's the one to bring AngelSaph's mood up. GiSY is very optimistic and would cheer AngelSaph up when times are tough, to always look on the bright side of life.

AngelSaph is also there when GiSY is isolated due to being emotionally damaged by others, especially by [that one nasty sociopathic person who bullies him and her](VXU.md#DeltaCXG). He helps her heal and recover too you know that? AngelSaph is aware of DeltaCXG bullying GiSY.
