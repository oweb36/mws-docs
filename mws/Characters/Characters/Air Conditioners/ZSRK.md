## Personality

> In a nutshell, a detective.
> TLDR: Cool! Fierce deducer. Short-temper ass boi that causes him to be impulsive. Do not underestimate this guy. But also be ware that he is firm on his stances.

ZSRK has a fierce personality, with the mind of a detective and a great deducer. He is ready to dive first into mysteries. He uses his awesome deductive and analysis skill to unravel even some of the most complex, or even unsolved puzzles. He knows where to look for things, and he knows what to do next. That's some great level detective skills.

ZSRK has a short-temper though, and that can lead him to do impulsive actions. He is also fairly stubborn at seeing other people's perspective. This can make him and others hard to solve mysteries. ZSRK is also fairly assertive with other people, and he will guide them on what to do.

ZSRK with his analytical and assertive nature makes him formidable. He is not to be underestimated.

## Relations

### [Fisios](Fisios.md)
They pair well. ZSRK can find info while Fisios does the heavy data crunching.

Fisios may have to handle ZSRK's temper outbreaks though. She might need a lot of mental strength, cus ZSRK is not the easiest to handle with.

### [KaHLium](KaHLium.md)
The dry joker and the temper-tantrum throwing detective comes together.

They aren't harmonious. There is quarreling and temper anger outbreak situations, which is not common, but not rare. Those situations are uncommon.

KaHLium doesn't like the anger issues of ZSRK. He is quite blatant on that. ZSRK doesn't accept this idea. This is a vicious cycle and why they are not harmonious when together.

They can work very well though if they have to. ZSRK can fetch and deduce things from crap, while KaHLium does the heavy data crunching. Its like Fisios, but KaHLium is more blunt and blatant.
