CTUX is a [character](Characters.md) as a member of [VXU](VXU.md) on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).
## Identity

 CTUX is a wall-mounted Daikin CTXU50G2V1B [heat pump](../../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). CTUX is an indoor unit to [VXU](VXU.md).


CTUX was born in August 12, 2008. CTUX is the bisexually-heteroflexible cis-male here.

CTUX has both arms and legs.

## Personality

TLDR: Strong willed, overconfident and arrogant-ass guy. Great at leadership and strategic thinking, but whatevs. Known to underestimate people at times. He can be humble though at times. Not that ~~sociopathic~~ psychopathic unlike [DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG). He would not willingly hurt others unlike DeltaCXG, and violence is too far. Would like to stop this psychopath, but CTUX does not have the power to do so unlike [MXU](#MXU) and would like to protect others. Is good.

CTUX is the overconfident and arrogant, but strong willed competitor, and is a good person in general. He is confident and determined. He can lead people with his great leadership skills, and is intelligent. He can strategically think.

CTUX's arrogance due to his confidence may lead him to underestimate others. Although his arrogance manifests quite often, at times he is humble

CTUX is not that psychopathic ~~sociopathic~~ though. He would not willingly hurt others, unlike his fellow brother [DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG). He finds physical violence too far for him. CTUX would also try to stop DeltaCXG if he can, like [MXU](#MXU) is brother, but he is too powerless to do so (at least MXU is the one capable of that). If he has power, CTUX would protect others.

CTUX inherently is not a bad person, but genuinely a good person. He is just too arrogant and leadership-oriented for this good side to manifest frequently.
