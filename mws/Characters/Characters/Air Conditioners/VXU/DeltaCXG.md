TLDR: Psychopathic, sadist and uncaring saboteur. Cares for a few (MXU, CTUX), but still bullies them (especially the latter). Empathy-lacking, enjoys people suffering. Noticeably targets girls more than boys. Not good.

DeltaCGX is the ~~sociopathic~~ psychopathic, sadistic and uncaring saboteur. He cares for his siblings (AKA those who is part of VXU, including MXU), but doesn't care about others except for a select few. Despite this, he still bullies [MXU](#MXU) because MXU is too kind.

He not only lacks empathy, he also enjoys watching other people suffer. Though not discriminatory, he noticeably targets girls more than the boys.

DeltaCXG is the bad person here. Well, it's more like he has a personality disorder, but that does not excuse what he does.
