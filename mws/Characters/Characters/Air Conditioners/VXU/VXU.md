# VXU

VXU is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). They originally appeared in [AACOS](../../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/AACOS.md), an old part of old ObjecWeb36. This is because they are not just one person.

[DeltaCXG](DeltaCXG.md) specifically was a host on old ObjecWeb36. Ig he still has that status, but for now he is just a competitor to win whatever [AEX](AEX/AEX.md) has.

## Identity

VXU is actually a multi-system triplet composed of 3 mind/people that is also a single person:
- [DeltaCXG (DCXG)](DeltaCXG.md)
- [CTUX](CTUX.md)
- [MXU](MXU.md)

 VXU is a **Daikin Multi-Ururu Multi-Split system**. VXU is a [heat pump](../../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md) system, as all their members (DeltaCXG, MXU and CTUX) are heat pumps. They are basically siblings, but also the kinda the same person.

[CTUX](CTUX.md) was from AACOS while [DCXG](DeltaCXG.md) was from an old part of old ObjecWeb36.

They are attached to a steel board with pipes and wires connecting them together, making them one. MXU is at the bottom, the legs of VXU, while DeltaCXG and CTUX is above MXU (CTUX is placed higher than DeltaCXG). MXU is the leg of VXU, while DeltaCXG and CTUX despite having legs, is instead the arms. DeltaCXG is one pair of arms, while CTUX is another pair of arms, so VXU has 4 arms in total.

MXU only has legs, but DeltaCXG and CTUX has both arms and legs. Its not that useful really as MXU is the legs of VXU, not DeltaCXG and CTUX.

VXU is non-binary (they/them), but their individual members are all strictly cisgender males.  The reason why VXU is non-binary, but MXU, CTUX and DeltaCXG is male is because VXU is not just one person, but three person as one person (aka referencing VXU is collective referencing).

If skin color matters, VXU is white.

Whatever you do, don't try to disconnect a member of VXU from VXU. That's quite rude and it hurts to do so. An example is disconnecting [MXU](MXU.md) from [DeltaCXG](DeltaCXG.md) by ripping DeltaCXG off or disconnecting their cables. It would hurt [CTUX](CTUX.md) too.

Funny thing is that because DeltaCXG was born later, this means that VXU before DeltaCXG is non-functional lol. VXU reached their full form when DeltaCXG was born (AKA November 11, 2011).

## Personality

Since VXU is a triad that is also a single person, each of the people in VXU has their own personalities. Each of them has contrasting personality that can balance each other out.

> Individually explained in [DeltaCXG/DCXG](DeltaCXG.md), [CTUX](CTUX.md), and [MXU](MXU.md).

## Relations

### [Avxy](Avxy.md)

Avxy actually fears [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG). He knows that DeltaCXG would go too far in harming others. While Avxy only wants to get people's reactions, DeltaCXG would actually harm them, literally. 
### [GiSelleY](GiSelleY.md)

[DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG) is the one who likes to bully GiSelleY. He knows that GiSelleY is sensitive, and he still does it. He just wants to feel her pain. DeltaCXG wants to be a sadist towards this poor soul who just wants to make the world a better place.

A pesk- ```I mean helpful``` fellow sibling of DeltaCXG (or [VXU](VXU.md)), [MXU](#MXU) is the reason why this bullying is not happening everyday. DeltaCXG would actually try to hurt GiSelleY, but MXU has been intervening in all of these cases, much to DeltaCGX's chargin and GiSelleY's ```help me pls idk the vocab pls```. MXU would intervene by walking away.

MXU is not always succesful in intervention though. DeltaCXG has hurt GiSelleY few times. DeltaCXG has said very nasty and demoralizing things to GiSelleY before MXU could intervene by walking away. 

DeltaCXG also has actually assaulted her succesfully, resulting in injuries to GiSelleY. He once punched and struck her so hard, he managed to crack her body. Yeah, DeltaCXG actually hits demigirls, and is a women beater (probably). Not that it matters though.

### [RXe](RXe.md)

VXU has a complicated relationship with RXe as they are 3 people in one.  RXe likes [MXU](VXU.md#MXU), as he is chill. He has done nothign wrong to RXe, and neither does she.

RXe has a slight disdain with [CTUX](VXU.md#CTUX) cus of his arrogance at times. She doesn't think he deserves or even qualify to lead people. RXe thinks he is too full of himself.

The one person of VXU that RXe has a problem with is [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) as DeltaCXG would also hurt others. RXe sees DeltaCXG as competition.

### [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md)

DeltaCXG on several occasions has hit AngelSaph on the back of his head/body. This has resulted in his halo breaking on the impacted section. He does this to him way too often for safety's sake. DeltaCXG enjoys AngelSaph's pain, which is technically child abuse.

DeltaCXG is not interested in harming AngelSaph emotionally and making him in pain that way, but enjoys causing him physical pain. DeltaCXG on some of these occasions has hurt AngelSaph so hard that his body actually managed to crack pretty badly, and bleed. 

[MXU](#MXU) has intervened on several of these incidents, with some being successful and some failing. AngelSaph sees MXU as his physical protector and actually likes him. He understands that MXU may not always be succesful. MXU always intervenes by walking away as thats the only thing he can do.

### [Wheamy](Wheamy.md)
Wheamy hates DeltaCXG for making not only his life hell, but burdens him in protecting others. DeltaCXG has harmed others, and potentially everyone. Wheamy doesn't need an extra abuser to deal with.

### [JVXH](JVXH.md)
JVXH fears DeltaCXG. She knows the weird things DeltaCXG would do. She has seen the horrors of DeltaCXG.

DeltaCXG wouldn't do anything to JVXH. Even though he knows that JVXH fears him, he doesn't care about her that much. DeltaCXG knows what JVXH would do.

### [MHeLy](MHeLy.md)
MHeLy is very accepting of DeltaCXG despite knowing the danger. MHeLy is one of the few people to actually have the balls to approach DeltaCXG.

### [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN/ToshyFEN.md)
VXU has two sides: Fear and concern.

[MXU](VXU.md#MXU) is quite concerned and fearful about ToshyFEN. MXU is concerned about his mental wellbeing, as you know ToshyFEN has some of the worst mental health states in MWS. He is also feareful because he knows that ToshyFEN can do some unhinged shit.

[CTUX](VXU.md#CTUX) has less concern and less fear compared to MXU, but he still has those feelings. He is less concerned because he feels that he can take on him if needed, but he won't for the most part.

[DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) has no concern, but more fear. DeltaCXG has no concern about his mental health, and why would he? DeltaCXG is this sociopath who doesn't care about others. He is willing to bully them for fun.  
DeltaCXG is also fearful of ToshyFEN because his mental health is not good and he can do unhinged shit again. DeltaCXG fears what ToshyFEN is capable of. Even with that, DeltaCXG would still try to bully this guy. DeltaCXG knows that ToshyFEN is one of the few people capable of stopping him.

So, MXU and CTUX are concerned and rather not get in trouble with ToshyFEN. DeltaCXg on the other hand, though knows the danger of ToshyFEN would still try to make some trouble with him.

#### [MHR](AEX/MHR.md)
MHR has a love-hate relationship with VXU.

MHR respects [MXU](VXU.md#MXU) for attempting to stop [this dumbass](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) if he can. MHR though feels at times MXU is incompetent or even slacking off at this responsibility.

MHR has problems with DeltaCXG. He does not like DeltaCXG bullying and harming others. MHR would rip DeltaCXG if he dares hurt [PCR](#PCR). MHR is also that one guy along with ToshyFEN to stop DeltaCXG if needed.
