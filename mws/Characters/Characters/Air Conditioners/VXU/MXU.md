## Personality

TLDR: Gentle. Not brash, and would stop [this ~~sociopath~~ psychopath](#DeltaCXG) from terrorizing and hurting others. Snap-ass. And is good, and has power unlike [CTUX](VXU.md) bruh.

MXU is the gentle one. He is not as brash as the others. MXU would even try to stop his fellow brothers, especially [DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG) from terrorizing others.

Can be assertive at times, especially with DeltaCXG. May also be quite snappy, but yeah that is him.

MXU is a good person definitely. He has power, but is armless.
