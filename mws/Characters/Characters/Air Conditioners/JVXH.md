JVXH is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]]. She originally appeared in [[AACOS]].

## Identity

She is a wall-mounted Daikin FTXG09HVJU [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md), a **Daikin Quaternity** unit. JVXH's name is pronounced as:
- Jay-Vee-Sih
- Jay-Vax
- J-V-X-H
She's an inferior version of [RXe](RXe.md) in a nutshell.

JVXH, being an inferior version to RXe, has the same design. There is just a little difference though. The only difference is with the indicators, where JVXH is missing one lamp (because she's inferior). JVXH after all is part of the Quaternity series, not the Ururu Sarara one!

JVXH was born in July 9, 2009. She is a cisgender and lesbian female (she/her).  
If skin color matters, she is gray just like RXe.

JVXH's teeth is unique. She has a chipped tooth, which is from her ruthless behavior. She also wears dental braces because tooth and its cool. Yeah, she's kinda tomboyish but idk.

## Personality

TLDR: Loyal friend, and good at leading. Won't waste friendships and will defend friends. Leads well by providing easy to understand and plain instructions with no whitewashing sugarcoating. JVXH has that some dark side in her though where she has no empathy for others and would deceive or even kill others to reach goals (She would even drink her victim's blood if she can).

JVXH is a chaotic neutral girl. She's got that school shooting capabilities in her, but she's also good with people. JVXH is also a force not to underestimate, especially with her loyalty to her friends and her (raw instructing) leadership skills.

## Loyalty
JVXH is very loyal to her friends, and will protect them. She is very protective and resourceful, and she will even do anything to protect her friends, even crossing some people's limits. She would do anything for her friends whom she's aligned with.

She will stay with her friends, even if somebody else tempts her with an even more appealing friendship or anything. Don't worry about JVXH betraying you basically, that is if you are friends with her. JVXH values your friendship a lot and will not let it go to waste.
## Darkness
She knows psychology well and will use it. JVXH can weave words to cause distrust and deceit. She's can deceive and her deceit is very convincing. It takes a lot to break out of her gaslighting circle of lies. She also has ***rizz*** to charm and manipulate you into her bidding. You won't feel it until it's too late, unless you are really that deep.

JVXH like I said is ruthless and unpredictable. You don't know what she will do next. She might deceive you or idk even worse things. You have to be prepared or expect the unexpected from JVXH. She has surprises for everyone, to catch them off guard. She likes it that way, **AKA** ambushing people.

With JVXH being ruthless, she will do whatever she can like [ToshyMEM](ToshyMEM.md). JVXH would sometimes use violence, murder or ***MANSLAUGHTER*** to do her bidding. Its pretty dark. And yes, like I said she has little empathy for others, but she **COMPLETELY HAS NONE** to those who are **OBSTACLES** to her way. JVXH is willing to kill and have blood in her hands. No remorse, care or guilt for others dying in pain. She enjoys their pain, and in fact will make her victims die painfully rather than dispatching them immediately. She's a sadist basically like I said. She would in fact drink her victim's blood if she can drink!
## Leader
JVXH is still a leader in this case, and she can lead others with her skills. But don't be a dead weight, or you'll face her wrath and doom. She can influence others to do the job for everyone, but sometimes also manipulate them to be deceived into doom.

JVXH may not have a large amount of charisma, but she is straight to the point. No sugar coating or twists and bends are thrown in her leading. There is no whitewashing or concealment. She just puts it as plainly as she can, making sure that people can easily understand it. This is one of the reason why she's good at leading: because she makes it easy to understand.

## Tomboy
JVXH is also a tomboy. She dislikes doing *girly* things such as dollhouses and crap. She like boy things, which kinda matches her personality a lot.

She would do boys things, and is quite competitive.

## Relations

### [RXe](RXe.md)
They are couples. They are very close to each other.

### [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG)
JVXH fears DeltaCXG. She knows the weird things DeltaCXG would do. She has seen the horrors of DeltaCXG.

DeltaCXG wouldn't do anything to JVXH. Even though he knows that JVXH fears him, he doesn't care about her that much. DeltaCXG knows what JVXH would do.

### [Xefa](Xefa.md)
JVXH fights with Xefa over who's the best lesbian couple. 

JVXH points out that Xefa is a valley girl, while Xefa accueses JVXH  of being a school shooter. That's *ad hominem* and its not civil.
