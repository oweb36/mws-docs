If skin color matters, Aurl is white.

Aurl is not the most intelligent in [MWS](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

## Personality
TLDR: Chill, unfazed and unbothered. Intel-gathering observer, questioning people's browsing history at times (slightly dissapointed in some of them). Uses intel for cunning plans. Outsmarter. Temper volatile, and can get nasty. Prone to school shooting. Darkness lays within him in the form of sadism, unleashed during temper outbreaks.

He is both positive and negative. He is normally calm, but no one can beat the chillness of [[WELLPan]].

He normally is unfazed and unbothered, or that is what he looks like on the surface. He is quite observant on his surrounding, allowing him to gather intel on others, and their browsing history. He is slightly disappointed with what some of them had looked up, but its not that major nasty.

This intelligence allows him to execute cunning plans and outsmart others. He also has a volatile temper, that can get really nasty at times. If he's angered, he is unpredictable! He might even start a school shooting all of a sudden!

Inside him, there is a dark part of him that wants him to hurt others. That dark part of him is sadism, and it manifests during his temper outbreak. He's a freaking sadist waiting to be unleashed.

## Relations

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)

They are frenemies, but they are more of a friend that enemies. The only conflict that they can be in is in a friendly little competition of who can be the chillest, and WELLPan always wins. They just hang out with each other.

### [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md)
Aurl respects ToshyFEN despite being older than him. Aurl knows about the strength of ToshyFEN, and how can his anger meltdowns go.
