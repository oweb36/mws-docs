# ToshyFEN

ToshyFEN is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). He originally appeared in [AACOS](../../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/AACOS.md).

## Identity

ToshyFEN is a Toshiba floor-standing RAV-RM1601FT-EN [heat pump](../../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Toh-she-Fen. Full name is ***Forthsys* Equen Newport**.

He was born in August 6, 2021, as a British person from England. He is a cisgender and heterosexual male. He/Him.

He is one of the most durable person in MWS; He can survive injuries that would incapacitate or even kill others, and he can tolerate severe pain such as crotch kicks. ToshyFEN is also very heavy, in fact he is the heaviest out of them all.

ToshyFEN is kinda the most intelligent, but also not the most intelligent. He is not sane enough to be able to handle this. He is one person, but [double minded literally](#Double%20Minded): [RBC-AMSUS](RBC-AMSUS.md) and [FEN](FEN.md). He is both sane and insane.

If skin color matters, ToshyFEN is white.

ToshyFEN is the younger brother to [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md). They almost look similar except to their controller, where ToshyFEN has the newer "Lite-Vision plus" one.

ToshyFEN also has a TCB-AX32E2 wireless receiver kit installed and attached to him, which is an auxiliary way to control him wirelessly. [RBC-AMSUS](RBC-AMSUS.md) is his brain and is exposed to the world, so he is careful of it.

### Double Minded

> See more on [FEN](FEN.md) and [RBC-AMSUS](RBC-AMSUS.md).

ToshyFEN actually has two minds, and each of his minds has a face. ToshyFEN is still the same person though.

The primary mind of ToshyFEN is [FEN](FEN.md), while the secondary mind is [RBC-AMSUS](RBC-AMSUS.md).

RBC-AMSUS is still ToshyFEN's brain though. ToshyFEN and FEN would die if RBC-AMSUS is killed btw, as RBC-AMSUS is literally his brain.

RBC-AMSUS cannot see well because his display is pixelated, but he ain't blind. Also RBC-AMSUS' face is not physically interactible, unlike FEN. RBC-AMSUS would typically use TCB as his voice, since RBC-AMSUS is mute on his own.

[FEN](FEN.md) and [RBC-AMSUS](RBC-AMSUS.md) are he/him because they are the same person as [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md). FEN and RBC-AMSUS are just different minds. And btw, ToshyFEN is he/him because he is not a [coll](../AEX/AEX.md)[ective](../VXU/VXU.md) but a single unit.

## Personality

TLDR: One person, two minds.  
TLDR2: Volatile but chill. One is insane and one is cautious. One should be in a mental hospital while the other does not. Caring but unstable.

ToshyFEN is one person, but he has multiple minds. 

[FEN](#FEN) is the volatile boi while [RBC-AMSUS](#RBC-AMSUS) is the chill and cautious one.

ToshyFEN is quite chill in general, but he can never be as chill as [WELLPan](WELLPan.md). ToshyFEN can also be insane and angrier than usual. FEN is the mind of ToshyFEN that is mentally unstable and insane, RBC-AMSUS is mentally stable and sane.

In a nutshell for the above, FEN is not OK but he is the most capable one while RBC is OK but he is 'disabled' to say the least. With this, ToshyFEN in general has some of the worst mental health state.

RBC is also more intelligent than FEN. This is because RBC is the brain and is more observant. FEN has a below average intelligence. RBC is one of the most intelligent and smartest mind in the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md) along with [JHR](AEX/JHR.md), [WELLPan](WELLPan.md) and [MHeLy](MHeLy.md). RBC can't really use his intelligence to the full potential because the below-average-intelligence FEN is the dominant mind.

ToshyFEN can be caring and will step in to protect. He does this if the situation warrants it such as if nobody is willing to or he is literally the only one capable to do so.

## Relations

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)

They are typically duos. WELLPan is the chiller in this duo, while ToshyFEN is the more active one. ToshyFEN is the motivator to WELLPan to get him to do something. WELLPan is aware of ToshyFEN's very bad mental health state, and he does whatever he can to keep it under control.

In this duo, they could actually destroy the entire cast of MWS due to their sheer physical strength. ToshyFEN would likely be the one to start it, and he would drag WELLPan into this madness. ToshyFEN would also probably stick WELLPan to his back, and bring him along.

ToshyFEN's meltdown might cause WELLPan to freak out if there's nobody to stop him.

### [Aurl](Aurl.md)
Aurl respects ToshyFEN despite being older than him. Aurl knows about the strength of ToshyFEN, and how can his anger meltdowns go. Aurl kinda fears but is concerned about ToshyFEN's very bad mental health state.

### [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md)
ToshyFEN loves ToshyMEF as a sibling. ToshyFEN and ToshyMEF know each other too well. Both ToshyFEN and ToshyMEF are some of the strongest people in [MWS](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md), after [WELLPan](WELLPan.md).

They are aware that they look very similar. Literally the only difference between them is that ToshyFEN's control panel is way newer than ToshyMEF's controller! ToshyMEF has the old Toshiba controller with icons, while ToshyFEN got that new "Lite-Vision plus" navigational and multilingual controller! Their main bodies even look the same. They like to prank others by impersonating each other.

ToshyFEN is wary of ToshyMEF's slight homophobia. He knows that ToshyMEF would go out to people of the LGBTQ+ community to say that LG TVs are better. He tries to restrain her from doing that rant.

ToshyMEF on the contrary is aware of ToshyFEN's quite horrible mental health. She is ready to subdue him when the situation is right. She has enough strength to do that. Sometimes ToshyMEF thinks whether ToshyFEN should go to a psychatric hospital.

### [RXe](RXe.md)
RXe finds ToshyFEN too unpredictable to manipulate. She doesn't know if what she does would trigger him. She doesn't even bother to manipulate ToshyFEN for her own because she doesn't know what would ToshyFEN do next.

ToshyFEN is the kind of person to stop RXe when she gets too far. ToshyFEN also in fact will and have stopped her multiple times.

ToshyFEN is scary to RXe eventhough RXe is the evil one. RXe is quite scared of ToshyFEN because ToshyFEN is quite unhinged at times and would kill. RXe questions whether he should be in a mental hospital, and sometimes doesn't know what to do with him.

### [Wheamy](Wheamy.md)
Wheamy doesn't know what to do with ToshyFEN. He has a dillema: help him or hate him. He doesn't know whether he should help and protect ToshyFEN or hate and try to avoid him.

Wheamy feels this way because he knows that ToshyFEN is still young, and in fact younger than him. Wheamy also knows that ToshyFEN needs some help because he is aware of his poor mental health. The other side is that Wheamy knows that ToshyFEN can be unhinged and angry. ToshyFEN might even make his life harder than what he has know.

Wheamy is very confused and worried about ToshyFEN. ToshyFEN to him is a mentally unstable person who needs help. This is because ToshyFEN fits both for Wheamy's need to help him and him making Wheamy's work harder.

### [VXU](../VXU/VXU.md)
VXU has two sides: Fear and concern.

[MXU](../VXU/VXU.md#MXU) is quite concerned and fearful about ToshyFEN. MXU is concerned about his mental wellbeing, as you know ToshyFEN has some of the worst mental health states in MWS. He is also feareful because he knows that ToshyFEN can do some unhinged shit.

[CTUX](../VXU/VXU.md#CTUX) has less concern and less fear compared to MXU, but he still has those feelings. He is less concerned because he feels that he can take on him if needed, but he won't for the most part.

[DeltaCXG](../VXU/VXU.md#DeltaCXG) has no concern, but more fear. DeltaCXG has no concern about his mental health, and why would he? DeltaCXG is this sociopath who doesn't care about others. He is willing to bully them for fun.  
DeltaCXG is also fearful of ToshyFEN because his mental health is not good and he can do unhinged shit again. DeltaCXG fears what ToshyFEN is capable of. Even with that, DeltaCXG would still try to bully this guy. DeltaCXG knows that ToshyFEN is one of the few people capable of stopping him.

So, MXU and CTUX are concerned and rather not get in trouble with ToshyFEN. DeltaCXg on the other hand, though knows the danger of ToshyFEN would still try to make some trouble with him.
