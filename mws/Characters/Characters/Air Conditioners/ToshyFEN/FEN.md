# FEN

FEN is a ["character"](Characters.md) as a component of [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md) on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).
## Identity

FEN is a Toshiba floor-standing RAV-RM1601FT-EN [heat pump](../../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is quite obvious. Still ***Forthsys* Equen Newport**.

FEN is the body of [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md), which means that his meta is the same. [RBC-AMSUS](RBC-AMSUS.md) is the brain to [FEN](FEN.md) and ToshyFEN as a whole. FEN is the first and primary mind to ToshyFEN.

FEN btw is the dominant one in [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md), while RBC-AMSUS is submissive.

## Personality

TLDR: Mentally unstable (is shit, but not as much as [CIFS'](../../../Bench/Air%20Conditioners/CIFS.md)). Have two sides because of his health.

FEN is the mentally unstable and insane mind of ToshyFEN. FEN is mentally not ok (insane and unstable). FEN basically has two personalities that are volatile at changing about. 

He is suffering from:
- *Borderline Personality Disorder*
- *Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder* 
- *Dissociative identity disorder*

Yeah, FEN should be in a psychiatric hospital but he's here. FEN has a relatively worse mental health in MWS compared to the rest. However, he is completely fine compared to [one guy](../../../Bench/Air%20Conditioners/CIFS.md).

 FEN has this one personality where he is really chill, and likes to chat. He can never be as chill as [WELLPan](WELLPan.md), but he is chill. He just listens, and talk a little. He likes small talk, and big talk. He is just there for WELLPan mostly, but can be there for others. Basically he just does nothing except listen and yap. FEN does observe people, but not that intently compared to [RBC-AMSUS](RBC-AMSUS.md). He just is passive.

In this passive side, he is well friendly but not that chatty like I said. But you know when I said he just talks a little, that's a half-lie. You can talk to him, but he does not talk to anyone on his own. You need to talk to him to be able to get him to talk you know that right? There's one type of chat he is good at and that is Big Talk. He does this better than [RBC-AMSUS](RBC-AMSUS.md) and in fact RBC leaves FEN to do the big talk. Why is he good? Idk.

Despite FEN being observant, he is not that intelligent. In fact, FEN is below average intelligent.

Then he has this other personality where he is straight up unhinged, crazy, insane, angry and violent. He commits harms to those who caused him this, and a bit of others. He isn't a sadist, but he is crazy. He literally chases others to no end with this. Yelling and screaming like a banshee as he runs. To no end he does this with no obvious goal at times. 

FEN would literally chase someone like a maniac, for eternity. He can be stopped and put back to his normal chill state by either calming him down, killing him, exhaust him or have his victim be killed.

FEN is pretty unpredictable due to his mental health, being one of the worst in [MWS](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). You can't predict when he will get angery and be triggered. Heck! You don't even know what triggers him as most of his triggers keeps on changing.

FEN is caring sometimes when he is chill. He would step in to stop carnage if he has too in situations where nobody except himself is strong enough to do so. [DeltaCXG](../VXU/VXU.md#DeltaCXG) is one such person who would create this kind of situations. If he is in his unhinged personality, this does not apply.

There's an exception though to that, RBC! FEN would do anything to protect RBC, as RBC is not only him, RBC is also his brain and also his "brother." FEN would even kill others just to protect RBC. FEN, even in his unhinged personality would still protect RBC.

FEN's volatile personality and mind can switch easily. He is caring though to some, especially [RBC-AMSUS](RBC-AMSUS.md).

Do not worry though! Its nothing compared to [CIFS](../../../Bench/Air%20Conditioners/CIFS.md)'s mental health!

## Trivia

- He's the body. But his mind resides within [RBC-AMSUS](RBC-AMSUS.md). This means if you removed RBC-AMSUS and out him on another body, FEN will come back.
