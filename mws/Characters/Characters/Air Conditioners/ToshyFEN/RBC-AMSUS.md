## Personality

TLDR: Cautious and chill. Sane unlike [FEN](#FEN). Smarter, but usually untrusting. If warmed up, he would trust you. Quite chatty, but find big talk awkward and leaves it up to FEN to do so. Is the brain, and so is cautious because if RBC dies then ToshyFEN dies. Observant and more intelligent than FEN, but does so discretely. Saner and would try to stop FEN but mostly is powerless except to influence FEN. Does not like you lobotomizing him and ToshyFEN.

RBC is the more cautious and chiller mind out of ToshyFEN. RBC is the mentally sane and stable mind out of ToshyFEN too.

RBC is pretty cautious about his surroundings. He is scared and untrusting normally of people. He fears what they can do to him and FEN. RBC just wants the best for ToshyFEN and his survival. RBC has this cautiousness because RBC knows that he is the brain and that if he dies, ToshyFEN dies.

RBC would warm up if he trusts someone. He is the chattier out of ToshyFEN normally. He small talks with people, but finds big talk (aka important talk) quite awkward and leaves it to FEN. RBC is also the one to try not to upset or be insenitive to others. 

RBC is very observant, even more observant than [FEN](#FEN). RBC observes things intently on the background while FEN is on the front scenes. This allows RBC to gather intel discretely and covertly when FEN is doing other things. RBC can use this to cook up some mighty blackmail or sabotage plans. RBC is also very intelligent due to him learning thru observation.

RBC is also the saner one, and he would try to stop FEN. RBC though doesn't have the power to control FEN because he is recessive, and wishes that one day he has just enough power to influence and control FEN. The only thing RBC can do is talk to FEN silently and influence his thoughts, but he has no power over the movement of ToshyFEN.

RBC cares for FEN and wishes he could help influence him for good, but he doesn't have enough power to do so. RBC knows that FEN really cares for him.

Also RBC-AMSUS does not like it if you tinker too much or deeply with him. By doing so, you are basically changing the way ToshyFEN's brain works. Nobody likes to get lobotomized, including RBC-AMSUS, [FEN](#FEN) and ToshyFEN. He might let you change temperature, fan and mode but do not try to go very deep and change deep setups like features, filter lifespan and all those other technical junkies bits. Please, by modifying them you are literally digitally-lobotomizing ToshyFEN.
