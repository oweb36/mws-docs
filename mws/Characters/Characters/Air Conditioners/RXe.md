RXe is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). She originally appeared in [AACOS](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/AACOS.md).

## Identity

RXe is a Daikin wall-mounted FTXR50EV1B9 [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). RXe is the **old Daikin Ururu-Sarara** series.

RXe was born in August 15, 2007. She's a cisgender and lesbian female (she/her).  
If RXe's skin color matter, she is gray.

RXe is the older sister to [ZeNer](ZeNer.md).

## Personality

TLDR: Evil and reckless. Goodness is questionable. Just don't be near her. If her personality can be condensed and distilled into one word: ***evil*** and two words: ***evil prick***.

She's just evil, with a slight bit of goodness (but massive to those close to her though). Don't trust her at all (mostly), her evilness overpowers her goodness unless you're really close with her.  Don't also underestimate her, you don't know how strong and evil she is. She is a force to be reckoned with.

RXe is fearless, and is reckless. She is evil to live for! She is evil to live her life! RXe would unapologetically and uncaringly push other people, limits and the challenges away. Others would be in awe, and they might also be hurt. RXe doesn't care though, she is just evil for this.

RXe is also manipulative with charisma. She makes herself seem good and attractive, but all she wants is to use and manipulate them. Her leadership skills is good, but she leads others to doom.

RXe has a bit of goodness and kindness, but is largely overshadowed and overpowered by her evilness. This goodness is fairly present and can overpower her evilness if she's with a really close friend of hers. But just don't be near her most of the time for the sake of you, please.

## Relations

### [MHeLy](MHeLy.md)

MHeLy is one of the people RXe is genuinely kind to. MHeLy has been supporting RXe, despite RXe being the opposite to her. RXe respects her as a person for being so nice despite RXe doing not so nice things.

### [JVXH](JVXH.md)

They are couples. They are very close to each other. JVXH is one of the people she's actually genuinely kind to, as they are lesbian couples.

### [VXU](VXU.md)

RXe has a complicated relationship with VXU as they are 3 people in one. She likes [MXU](VXU.md#MXU), as he is chill. He has done nothign wrong to RXe, and neither does she.

RXe has a slight disdain with [CTUX](VXU.md#CTUX) cus of his arrogance at times. She doesn't think he deserves or even qualify to lead people. RXe thinks he is too full of himself.

The one person of VXU that RXe has a problem with is [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) as DeltaCXG would also hurt others. RXe sees DeltaCXG as competition.

### [Wheamy](Wheamy.md)
Wheamy hates the shit out of RXe. He has to deal with many potential abusers to his dependees. He doesn't need more!

### [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md)
RXe finds ToshyFEN too unpredictable to manipulate. She doesn't know if what she does would trigger him. She doesn't even bother to manipulate ToshyFEN for her own because she doesn't know what would ToshyFEN do next.

ToshyFEN is the kind of person to stop RXe when she gets too far. ToshyFEN also in fact will and have stopped her multiple times.

ToshyFEN is scary to RXe eventhough RXe is the evil one. RXe is quite scared of ToshyFEN because ToshyFEN is quite unhinged at times and would kill. RXe questions whether he should be in a mental hospital, and sometimes doesn't know what to do with him.

### [Xeo](Xeo.md)
RXe and Xeo rather not fight, even though RXe is evil. RXe thinks that Xeo is not even worthy to fight, but is forced.

Who forces them? [Xefa](Xefa.md) and [JVXH](JVXH.md).
