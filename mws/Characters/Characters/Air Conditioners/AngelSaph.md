Gender-Identity: Demifluid Male
---
AngelSaph is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].

## Identity

He is a Gree Sapphire SAP18HP230V1AH wall-mounted [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Angel-Saph.

He was born on September 13, 2022. He is a demifluid male (he/they). This means that he is half male and half genderfluid. Normally his genderfluid side is female, making him bigender, but he can change his genderfluid side into any other if the circustance and situation warrants it. This means that AngelSaph is also mutogenderous. You can also count him as bigender, but its is a kind-off situation.

AngelSaph also has a halo. Its detailed in the section titled [Halo](#Halo). He is a partial Angel.

He has flesh unlike others of MWS.

### Body

AngelSaph's body is unique because he is not purely electronic, but has flesh. AngelSaph is technically a Cyborg and needs to eat and drink to survive to satisfy his cells. His biological side is of Homo Sapiens.

AngelSaph doesn't need to excrete waste or breath though as his electronics provides energy for the cells to respire. His organic flesh supplements and enhances his inorganic electronics, not the other way around. This flesh means that AngelSaph actually has true free will unlike the others as he has a brain, not just some hardcoded motherboard with some self-learning AI.

AngelSaph has a circulatory system and A+ blood. This means that he could actually bleed to death or die of exsanguination. AngelSaph can also get cut, lacerated and bruised easily.

If either of AngelSaph's biological or electronic-cyborg side dies, he as a whole would also die. This is because despite the electronic side of AngelSaph being the majority of him, it also depends on his biological side.

His biological side is well, male. His biological sex is male despite him only being demifluid. His body also doesn't age, and won't die due to old age ever (Its immortal except due to injuries or brutality).

### Halo
AngelSaph's halo is a floating shiny white-golden halo that surrounds him. Its tilted up to the right of AngelSaph and it can glow in the dark a yellow shine. Its an intergral part of his body; You can't just detach and knock AngelSaph's halo of him, but you can push the halo as its not rigidly fixed to him.

Its composed of an alloy made of Gold, Titanium, Platinum, Aluminium, Phosphor and Fluorine. This halo is hard and glows in the dark as a result of it. It slowly spins clockwise, though if he is in a bad mental health state, it will slow down and in cases where his mental health is extremely bad, it will slowly spin counter-clockwise.

AngelSaph's halo can act as a protection for any attacks against him due to its composition. If his halo gets damaged (cracked, shattered, broken), it can regenerate slowly over time. If he is emotionally hurt, in trauma, in a bad state of mental health or experiencing emotional pain, then his regeneration of the halo will slow down. If he is emotionally hurt enough, the regeneration of his halo may stop.

The Halo being an intergral part of AngelSaph's body can give him tactile sensation. Here are what he can feel: 
- Sharp pain. He will feel sharp pain if his halo is broken via harsh impact or pretty aggressive bonks. Its a sharp pain.
- Dulled pain and ache. He will feel this (slightly dulled) pain and aching from his remaining halo that is broken.
- Extreme pain. He will feel this if only a small remaining bit of his halo is remaining. This basically means that his halo is severely damaged, basically almost destroyed. He can pass out at this point.
- Not so dull headache. He will feel this if the halo is completely destroyed, or basically the halo is damaged to the point no remaining bit is intact. In a nutshell, AngelSaph will feel this kind of headache if he has no halo, or just looks like a normal [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md).
- Touch. He will feel touch on his halo if you touch his halo.
- Dull ache. He would feel a dull aching feeling if you tug or pull on his halo. This is already rude to do, as thats like pulling someone's by their ponytail.

Whenever AngelSaph's halo is damaged, any parts that were broken off will no longer float with him and instead falls down. The remaining intact halo still floats, and spins in place as if it were a complete halo. The remaining intact halo also begins to slowly bleed a liquid known as eether.

Eether is a liquid that is contained within AngelSaph's halo. Its harmless to touch, but its just chilling inside of his halo. Eether appears as a golden to piss-yellow colored tear-like liquid. It smells ethereal like floral-ethereal ethereal. Eether is denser than water. Eether is the liquid that bleeds from AngelSaph's broken halo.

His Halo breaking can only occur due to physical forces. You can't just give him emotional damage to break it. So you can't just demoralize him to the point of no return to just completely destroy his halo into oblivion. The halo's state is not a representation of his emotional and mental health, but the rotation of the halo is representational of his mental health.

One way you can break his halo easily is just by whacking him with a blunt weapon on the back of his head/body. Its that easy lol, a whack and the back portion of his halo is now broken. The back of his head is a weak point for his halo. Its not that weak when compared to absolute, but very weak when compared to the rest of his halo. Whacking him on the front though, is very obvious to him and it would at best, just crack his halo instead of breaking it.

## Personality
TLDR: Gentle, Depressed, Reserved, Empathetic. Sensitive, Calm, Stoic, Pretty stoic on the outside (on the inside is a whole other story). Vulnerable. Emotionally stable, slow, and quite a chill guy. Emotional hiding.

AngelSaph is well, quite reserved. He is also empathetic, caring about your issues. He would do whatever he can to make you feel better, quite gently. He cares about your emotions and would make you feel better.

AngelSaph himself is quite reserved and introverted. He is quite calm and stoic, rarely showing any emotions. You can feel the aura, but he does not make his emotions obvious. He is quite passive indeed, chill and slow.

He is the kind of guy to let things play out. AngelSaph might strike in if he sees that the situation has gone too far. In this case, well he will come in and risk his halo to deescalate the situation.

AngelSaph is quite vulnerable and sensitive to attacks and abuses. He is sensitive to both emotional and physical abuse, but is more vulnerable for the latter. If his halo is damaged, it causes pain in him and that affects him a lot.

He on the inside, though is another story. It's quite a struggle there. He is quite depressed due to his status being an Angel. Some parts of his emotional health is tied to the status of his halo. And yes, AngelSaph is still sane but is struggling with who he is and his mental health. He is basically eternally tortured.
