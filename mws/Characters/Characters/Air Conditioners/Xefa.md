Xefa is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

## Identity

She's a Panasonic CS-XE12EKE wall-mounted [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). Her name is pronounced as Xe-fa.

She was born in July 16, 2006. She is a cisgender and lesbian female (she/her).  
If skin color mattered, she's white.

She wears dental braces because she's the valley girl. Not for *bri'ish* teeth, but for *valley girl* cosmetic reasons. Yes, valley girls wear braces because they are valley girls not nerd girls.

## Personality
TLDR: Valley Girl. Teenager. "bitch" user. Sassy and rude, but loyal and kind. Dumb, but **NOT THAT** dumb. Serial gossiper.

The Valley Girl of [MWS](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). Speaks with an exaggerated Californian accent, because she's **THE** Valley Girl. Xefa is also known for speaking like a Teenager, with her overusing "like" everywhere, like Valleyspeak (or what we call Valley Girl-aah linguistics). And also is sassy and rude at times.

Xefa is also known to "bitch" everywhere. "bitch" is a common word for her, to the point it has the status of a filler word like "like" you know eh? Basically she might go "you know that right, bitch?" and "hey girlie bitch!" and those things.

Also notably flirty and horny, but not rampantly promiscuous. She might flirt and make you well **you know**, but she is not looking for **SEX**. No, she does not want that and she cannot. She just wants to flirt and is horny, but **NOT THAT HORNY**.

You know, like I mentioned, she is also sassy and rude. She has that sass and confidence like those alpha bitch girls in high school. And also quite rude and snarky. "bitch" is her thing. Not the most welcoming, but do not be the fool! She has a golden heart on the inside! But still, she is still sassy and rude because that is her personality.

She is genuinely kind if you get to know her. This is what I mean when her heart is gold. But also do not be a fool again! Her heart may be golden, but **NOT THAT** golden. The sass and rudeness is still there, but its for the snark fun! Yeah, she is genuinely kind, but not nice. 

And yes, she is also loyal cus you know. She does not betray, cus that is not fun and kind of her. Still, the sass and rudeness is still there. But trust me, she is a good friend and ally.

> **NICE != KIND**

The funny thing is that Xefa will always act like a Teenager despite her growing. She just gets wiser, but in her heart she will always be a Teenager in an aging body. Teens are sassy and rude, and that is why Xefa is that way.

With that, she is a serial gossiper. Give her a gossip and there she goes!

She isn't smart, or even intelligent that much. If Xefa had hair and stereotype, she would also be the dumb blonde. Xefa is not a brainless beauty alright, she still has some intelligence, just not a lot. Xefa is **NOT THAT** dumb to the point where she forgets how to breath (not) or even live (also neither). She can do math, but the elementary one (AKA arithmetic). Her dumbness is **NOT SO DUMB** she cannot even walk, or do arithmetic. 

>Xefa has **intelligence to LIVE and even DO ARITHMETIC**, not for higher-problem solving like trigonometry and stuff.

## Relations

### [Xeo](Xeo.md)
They are couples eh. 

Its not harmonic, but very vitriolic. But its good, cus they know what is great.

It may seem not harmonious, but it somehow is. And Xeo's love language is well [slightly](void:a-massive-understatement) lacerating.

You can ay that this is a `Vitrionic Best Friend` kind of relationship, except that it is romantic too (and sexual due to no ace).

### [JVXH](JVXH.md)
JVXH fights with Xefa over who's the best lesbian couple.

JVXH points out that Xefa is a valley girl, while Xefa accueses JVXH  of being a school shooter. That's *ad hominem* and its not civil.

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)

WELLPan is chill. She has no qualms with him.

Not a lot to say.
