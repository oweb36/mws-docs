# ZeNer

ZeNer is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

## Identity

ZeNer is a Daikin FTXZ50NV1B wall-mounted [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Zee-Ner, like zener diodes. Zener is the new **Daikin Ururu Sarara**, AKA the **Daikin Ururu Sarara 7 *(US7)***.

He was born in August 16, 2017. He is a genderfluid pansexual, but prefers to be male (he/him) except under certain circumstances aka being mutogender. Fine english.

ZeNer is also Zeneryse in full glory.

He is the younger sibling of [RXe](RXe.md).

If skin color matters, he is white.

## Personality

> TLDR: Daredevil Dumbass. Expert at Stunts though. Probably brain-damaged. Life-risker.

Daredevil. ZeNer is the one who would do reckless stunts in order to impress others. He knows well about what stunts, and is basically an expert. So even though he risks his own and other's lives, he usually is successful in doing so. Some of his stunts can fail though, but its very rare.

ZeNer is also not the most intelligent. He out of all people would always choose some of the most dangerous stunts. He probably became less intelligent due to some of his stunts (in rare cases) failing and causing "brain" damage or whatever is equivalent, but yeah there's this endless cycle now. He risks his life though with his not so alright intelligence.

## Relations

### [XKC](../../Bench/Air%20Conditioners/XKC.md)

They are great friends! XKC is the restraint though, monitoring the genderfluid Hi-Tech boy that is ZeNer so he would not die!

XKC tomfucks while ZeNer Jackasses.

### [Avxy](Avxy.md)

We got the daredevil and the prankster here. Combine two and you get a pretty jackass prank. They are very good at their thing, which is making reckless pranks.

Please, do not get ZeNer and Avxy together for the sake of everybody else.

## Trivia

- **FTXZ-N** reminds me of **zener diodes**, so that's why I call him that.
