## Personality

> TLDR: Daredevil Dumbass. Expert at Stunts though. Probably brain-damaged. Life-risker.

Daredevil. ZeNer is the one who would do reckless stunts in order to impress others. He knows well about what stunts, and is basically an expert. So even though he risks his own and other's lives, he usually is successful in doing so. Some of his stunts can fail though, but its very rare.

ZeNer is also not the most intelligent. He out of all people would always choose some of the most dangerous stunts. He probably became less intelligent due to some of his stunts (in rare cases) failing and causing "brain" damage or whatever is equivalent, but yeah there's this endless cycle now. He risks his life though with his not so alright intelligence.
