# RACK

RACK is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). He originally appeared in [AACOS](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/AACOS.md).

## Identity

He is a Hitachi RAK-60NH4 wall-mounted [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as rack, just like rack-mounted servers.

He was born in January 3, 2003. He is a cisgender and heterosexual male.

He is the elder brother and sibling to [TERAS](TERAS.md) and [Raiie](Raiie.md) respectively.

If skin color matters, RACK is beige.

## Personality

TLDR: Disciplined. Might break discipline if he has too, but reluctant and would prefer being in the box. Open minded and less dogmatic than [CKHSC](CKHSC.md), always trying to find a balance. Neutralist who would always find the neutral. If he can't be neutral, he would find a suitable point based of now and future.

RACK is fairly disciplined. He likes to stay on schedule and follow the line. He is not happy if you force him to go out of the box. He will still go out of the box, break conventions and bend the rules if he has to albeit reluctantly.

He is open-minded even though he is a traditionalist. RACK might even want to make a progressive form of the traditions with some form from the new modern era. He will try to figure out a balance of the trusted traditions and the new and fast-moving new culture.

RACK always tries to find balance in all things. He is the neutralist even though ironically he ain't one between his [sib](TERAS.md)[lings](Raiie.md). RACK believes in the philosophy of *everything is good in moderation*. Basically RACK would always go for the *true neutral*. If he can't he would choose what is best for the heat of the moment and the future.
