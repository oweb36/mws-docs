# GHR

GHR is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant (ig) on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).
## Identity

GHR is a Sharp wall-mounted AY-XP12GHR [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). A deluxe one, and also a nordic inverter too! 

Obvious where her name is derived from. Pronounced as G-H-R (Gee-H-Are).

Skin color would be gray and silvery if maters, shiny and glossy too. Also GHR heils from France, but she is French-Norwegian.

GHR was born in October 24, 2006. She is a cisgender heterosexual female (she/her). Btw she likes fashion.

### Outfit (WTF)

Since she's a Fashionista, we gotta give her smth to make her stand out.

## Personality

> TLDR: A fashionista, and a vain one too. A sassy diva, and also the charismatic queen bee. A snappy one. A rude gal with a hidden heart of gold. Also quite nice and kind too when you get to her.
> TLDR2: She's a mature woman despite those. Knows boundaries and things. 

She is the one who likes fashion. Quite vain. Problem? Very dramatic she does! `Oh my` `Why does it always happen to me` aah kind of vanity.

And yes, she is also a sassy diva. She has that energy of confidence from her. GHR is also quite bold, and energetic. So do not assume she chill. GHR is also charismatic, able to charm people. This says a lot about her.

Also she is quite rude and blunt at times. Might dismiss people as lower. She might assume someone lesser to her is not that capable. This is how she is rude. But, she has a golden heart AKA a good one inside. Know her, and you see the semi-real one.

GHR is nice and kind if you see her. Quite supportive actually if you befriend her. So yeah you can enjoy her once you know her.

With that, lemme say this: She is **mature**. GHR is a mature woman. She knows boundaries and things, and will drop the rudeness if she is death-glare'd at or smth tells her not to and its serious. Speaks quite maturely lol.
