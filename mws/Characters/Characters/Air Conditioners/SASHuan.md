# SASHuan

SASHuan is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).
## Identity

SASHuan is a Mitsubishi Electric floor-standing PSH-6GJHSA [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). 

Heiling (partly) from Mother Russia, is he. Also Spanish, because he is also `Juan`. Yes, that's right he is `Juan`. `Juan` is indeed also his name. So, he is Spanish-Russian.

SASHuan/`Juan` is white, but funnily he is still pristine and white, not yellowed unlike the other that are actually **O L D** ([Aufs](Aufs.md)).

Name derived from P**SH**-6GJ**SA**, and also Juan because [Juan](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/juan-horse-on-balcony) and [Juan](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/juan), so **SASH** + Juan = SASHuan. Feel free to call him `Sash` if you want to, or `Juan`. Like I said, SAShuan is also `Juan`.

SASHuan was born in July 13, 1997 (He is old boi). He is a cishet male (he/him).

Has a spinoff show called [STYTC](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Spinoffs/STYTC.md) where he shows real chemistry.

SASHuan is indeed `Juan`.
### Brilliance

Well, SASHuan is nothing without his briliance.

What is he brilliant at? Chemistry, specifically **organic chemistry**, **thermochemistry**, **rate of reaction**, **acid-base reactions and salting**, **nitration**, and **stoichiometry**. That's right, he may be stupid in plain and applied math, and physics, but he does great at Chemistry. Though he has all that chemistry specifics, he is best at organic chemistry, acid-base reactions, and stoichiometry (and in fact is why he has his spinoff show [STYTC](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Spinoffs/STYTC.md)).

He may know basic math, but he knows nothing about advanced algebra. That's for [CeRNY](../../Bench/Air%20Conditioners/CeRNY.md) to cover!

## Personality
> TLDR: Slightly anxious and nervous, but very briliant
> TLDR2: That one (organic) chemist who is very smart, but umm terrible at socialization.
> TLDR3: Think of SASHuan as that scientist who was isolated for too long while stoichiometring.
> TLDR4: Juan

SASHuan, you can say, is that one scientist who is anxious and nervous about anything. He never seems to settle down, always on alert and ready for something. Quite jumpy to say. You can also say, that he is the sweat.

He may be terrible at socialization, but he smart. Despite this, he can thrive and survive even with this socialization bottleneck (CeRNY and Flerovy). Idk why, but I think logical minds can work together. Think of SASHuan as that one guy who was isolated for too long.

## Relations

### [CeRNY](../../Bench/Air%20Conditioners/CeRNY.md) and [Flerovy](Flerovy.md)

These 3 are the perfect partners in science. Very good people grouping here, yeah.

CeRNY can do the math, while SASHuan can do the stoichiometry, and Flerovy can do the precise movements of adding the chemicals.

A well-oiled trio they are. CeRNY, SASHuan, and Flerovy, are capable of executing some of the greatest chemical feats (they have ever seen). They know how to handle a lot of crazy things, which may or may not be: `nitrating toluene into TNT`, `handling nitroglycerin`, etc... Funny, SASHuan thrives here despite his socialization..

They are great at working together, and they have no qualms of animosity. They hang out with each other, cus they great. Somehow SASHuan can work with them despite his socialization skills being a **NOT**.

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md) and [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN/ToshyFEN.md)

WHat do you expect? They have no problems, especially with [`Juan`](SASHuan) and WELLPan. 

They can combine their brain power together, and cook cool things. WELLPan is not crazy though, he wouldn't come up with a pyromaniac's love interest. Do not worry, they won't [nitrate toluene](void:Hell-Nah-Thats-Making-Trinitrotoluene-AKA-TNT) together.

SASHuan is slightly unnerved by ToshyFEN because you know the latter guy is quite unstable. He might be umm slightly scared, but other than that no blemishes. They can have fun together, and especially with WELLPan. SASHuan is still careful of ToshyFEN because the latter might go berserk.
### [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md)

They are not to be put together ig. ToshyMEF would manipulate [`Juan`](SASHuan) into making dangerous chemicals that could kill. Also ToshyMEF would probably keep on disturbing SASHuan with his chemistry.

### [PFSA](PFSA.md), [ASTAC](ASTAC.md), and [CKHSC](CKHSC.md)

These 4 would be great ig. PFSA may have less influence, because PFSA is a such bumblingly-drunk bubbly guy that he might accidentally mix dangerous chemicals with SASHuan.

ASTAC would probably learn from [`Juan`](SASHuan.md), because ASTAC is still learning life even at an old age. CKHSC is the one to well, tell SAShuan to slow down because nobody likes their chemicals exploding in their face.

### [JHR](AEX/JHR.md)

Well, this is one of those cases where JHR actually looks up to somebody else. SASHuan is clearly superior to JHR, but only for specialized situations that we call as Chemistry.

JHR is more to the general knowledge, and SASHuan is there to fill JHR's gap on Chemistry. And it's specifically **organic chemistry**, **thermochemistry**, **rate of reaction**, **acid-base reactions and salting**, **nitration**, and **stoichiometry**.
