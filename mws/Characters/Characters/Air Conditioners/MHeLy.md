# MHeLy

MHeLy is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). She originally appeared in [AACOS](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/AACOS.md).
## Identity

MHeLy is a wall-mounted Sharp AY-A9MHL [air conditioner](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). MHeLy is the 5th generation in the Sharp Sayonara Panas series, AKA she is the **Sayonara Panas V/Sayonara Panas 5** air conditioner. Her name is pronounced as M-H-Elly. You can write her name as MHLy (That's the original, but somehow it got lost), but she would prefer if you write her name as MHeLy.

She was born in March 19, 2012. She is a cisgender and heterosexual female.

MHeLy is one of the most intelligent person in MWS. She's also one of the weaker ones though. She's also the straightest out of anyone here in MWS.

If skin color matters, MHeLy is gray and silver.

Her elder brother is [KaHLium](KaHLium.md).

Her voice would probably be a high-pitched girlish feminine voice with softness and squeak into it. We can describe it like Pinky Pie from MLP, but smth else is different.

She wears dental braces, just for cosmetic reasons. I believe braces fit her so well with her personality. She has no crooked teeth, she just wants braces.

MHeLy also has *very sharper than average* canine teeth despite her personality. Nobody knows why, but her canine teeth is way sharper.

## Personality

TLDR: Nice, empathetic and kind-hearted. Innovative and creative. Willing to help others and even self-sacrifice herself. Pacifist, but would do violence if given no choice. Self-doubting at times, and self-isolate as coping method. She may feel that she is being used, but she would bounce back. Has good friends and relations. People may declare themselves as enemies of MHeLy, but kindness pays off in the end.

MHeLy is one of the nicer people in MWS. This is probably because she's a girl (More like woman. Wait, isn't that sexist? Probably, probably not. Nah).

MHeLy is a kind-hearted and empathetic to others. She is very creative with her work and competition, and even innovative. She is kind-hearted and willing to help others, even sacrificing herself at times. MHeLy is a pacifist, but she would still do violence if she has no choice.

MHeLy may also have self-doubt and be insecure at times, where she should withdraw and isolate herself from the others. She sometimes feels that with her principle of being nice and only attacking for defense, that she is used. But then she will bounce back!

MHeLy with her kindness, mostly forms good bonds and relationships with the others. She looks for friends too, but there are others who don't want to be friends with her. Some even declare themselves as enemies to MHeLy, but her kindness will pay off in the end.

So, MheLy is one of the warm characters in MWS.
## Relations

### [AEX](AEX.md)
MHeLy is a close friend to [JHR](AEX.md#JHR), and vice versa. MHeLy has known JHR other for longer compared to anybody else in her. They have enjoyed time together, playing and watching the silver of the night skies.

## [KaHLium](KaHLium.md)
MHeLy is KaHLium's younger sister. KaHLium loves her and is protective of her. MHeLy motivates and makes KaHLium happy when he's down.

### [GiSY](GiSY.md)
They are good friends. MHeLy and GiSY's caring nature pairs them together. They would work together to not only care, but make the world a better place for everyone.

They are very happy together. They aren't a couple though. MHeLy is not a lesbian or LGBTQ in nature alright?

## [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md)
She's the one to heal him emotionally. MHeLy is one of the few to know the depressive nature of AngelSaph. She knows about his position and role, but understands the pressure.

She cares for him, and is with him when AngelSaph needs help the most. She just stands by him, and that helps AngelSaph.

### [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG)
MHeLy is very accepting of DeltaCXG despite knowing the danger. MHeLy is one of the few people to actually have the balls to approach DeltaCXG.
