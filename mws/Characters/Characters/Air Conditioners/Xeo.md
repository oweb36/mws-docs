Xeo is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

## Identity

She's a Panasonic CS-XE21MKEW wall-mounted [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). Xeo is a superior version of [JKE](JKE.md). Her name is pronounced as Xeo (AKA Seyo). Don't call her shio or sio (AKA see-yo), she would attack you for that.

She was born in August 10, 2010. She is a cisgender and bisexual female (she/her).  
If skin color mattered, she's silver.

## Personality
> **3 TLDRS??? WTF**
> 
> TLDR part1: Angry-ass. Bitchy-ass catty girl. Quite hostile, especially to women/girls. Gives you ***EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!*** Known to physically assault others, in the most girlish way we men call as **Catfighting**. Usually falls like a **sad** if someone does decides to strike back. Almost never in a good mood. 
> TLDR part2: Anger may subside, but **NEVER** fully. My be good, but **NOT** that as she is still an asshole Yes, has a golden heart, but shadowed by anger and eternal rage. Known to use harm and laceration as a love language, since thats all she knows to show love. Yeah, she has social skill issues lol.
> TLDR part3: Also an extremely deadpan serial snarker, who is also brutally blunt and honest. She is known to deadpan snark people a lot. And also she tends to speak with truth, that is typically extremely brutal and blunt.


She's the angry-ass catty one.

Yeah, she is also smart enough. May not be *academia* smart, but is **street** smart.

You might say: "She's actually an evil person, she does this for fun!" **N O P E**! There's a valid reason for her pretty rude and aggressive behavior.

While other characters like [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md) and [Aurl](Aurl.md) has their chill moments. She ain't [WELLPan](WELLPan.md) bruh.

Despite that, she can be good. Not nice, not kind, just good in some mysterious way. So yeah, we got an extremely angry good girl here eh this lesbian bitch-ass ~~faggot~~-slag. And yes, she has some goodness, but shadowed by the anger.

She is known to be good with her girlfriend(s), but still quite a wrathful ragin' bitch-ass woman/girl she is.

And oh! She is also a deadpan snarker. The extreme one. She is a serial snarker, whose snarking tends to be extremely deadpan. So its quite rude compared to other's deadpan snarking. Also a trait of her anger.

And also Xeo is quite brutal and blunt with her honesty. She is very honest, a good thing. Problem: Very brutal and blunt. She does not dampen or soften it, just the hard truth.

## Relations

### [Xefa](Xefa.md)
They are couples eh. 

Its not harmonic, but very vitriolic. But its good, cus they know what is great.

It may seem not harmonious, but it somehow is. And Xeo's love language is well [slightly](void:a-massive-understatement) lacerating.

You can ay that this is a `Vitrionic Best Friend` kind of relationship, except that it is romantic too (and sexual due to no ace).

### [JKE](JKE.md)
Xeo sees JKE as an inferior version of herself. She does not like him. She would talk shit about him, being inferior.

Crap talks of Xeo: "You ain't deluxe," "Why so small?"

You get it.

### [NAEphthalene (NEptha)](NAEphthalene.md)
NAEpthalene dislikes Xeo. Its because Xeo is a woman, and just catty.  He doesn't exactly like her overly aggressive behavior. And also NEptha is a freaking sexist.

Well, Xeo also dislikes him cus he's a bastard.

### [RXe](RXe.md)
RXe and Xeo rather not fight, even though RXe is evil. RXe thinks that Xeo is not even worthy to fight, but is forced.

Who forces them? [Xefa](Xefa.md) and [JVXH](JVXH.md).

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)

WELLPan is chill. WELLPan is one of the people Xeo has no problems with.

Xeo might snark WELLPan once in a while, but its not **THAT** big of a deal since WELLPan is chill and Xeo has no qualms.
