# Flerovy

Flerovy is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

## Identity

Flerovy is a Daikin FVQ125BV1B floor-standing [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced Flerovy.

Straight from the UK, he is from Scotland. He ain't your normal stereotypical Scottish though.

Flerovy was born April 10, 2008. He is a cisgender and heterosexual male.

[Intelligent](#Intelligence) and [precise](#Precission).

### Intelligence

> Of course we need this.

When we say Flerovy is intelligent, its a bit orthodox.

You see, his intelligence is with spatiality, not logic. He is not good with math and chemistry ([CeRNY](../../Bench/Air%20Conditioners/CeRNY.md) and [SASHuan](SASHuan.md) things), but he does know about precision and spatial intelligence.

He still knows common knowledge, and is kinda an encyclopedia. Ask him miscellaneous things and he will give it to you. Ask him specialized questions like math, and he will fold like a paper. And it might trigger his perfectionistic trait.

What spatial intelligence? He can map out, imagine, and simulate the 3d world mentally. Even if it is complex, he still can. Put a bunch of people, objects and things in a room, and he can probably pack them well. Ig he used all his intelligence points on spatial intelligence.

### Precision

One of Flerovy's unique abilities is his precise movements. His movements is precise to 1 microMeter. This means he is capable of moving things with high precision, allowing him to align things that require high precision.

He needs time though, because precision needs time. Give him enough time, and Flerovy can move an object for you by 30 microMeters.

## Personality

> TLDR: Spatial-intelligent and slightly-shy introvert. OCD-afflicted perfectionist, with compulsive actions to perfect anything (even in inappropriate moments). Large knowledge base (not as big as [JHR](AEX/JHR.md) and others on par with him) Unwilling mentor, rather be chill. Quite affable and friendly if approached at the right way.

Flerovy is well one of the (spatial) intelligent fellas here in [MWS](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). His knowledge base is quite huge (he is spatial intelligent) but not as much to his peers (such as [JHR](AEX/JHR.md), [MHeLy](MHeLy.md), [WELLPan](WELLPan.md), [SASHuan](SASHuan.md), and [CeRNY](../../Bench/Air%20Conditioners/CeRNY.md)). He does not want to teach but rather be on his own and do his own things and chilling but people still seek to him whenever those three big people aren't available. Flerovy basically likes to keep his knowledge to himself, because its relatively abysmal.

From that, you see that Flerovy is quite introverted. He is also shy, staying away from bold actions on the front scene. He is the *behind-the-scenes* kind of guy. 

Flerovy also has perfectionism problems. He is so bothered with imperfect things (like [Awu](Awu.md)) to the point where he would correct them. He is quite compulsive with this behavior and will even do it in inappropriate moments. Flerovy would be bogged with thoughts of the imperfect thing and correct them *on-the-spot*. He will even recheck the imperfect object in question multiple times even if he has correct them. Yeah, he has OCD.

Don't worry, he rarely gets stuck in an OCD loop ig. He does not really need to spend a lot of time (unlike Awu), because he is [precise](#Precission). He can just spend some time precisely moving around objects with his hands, and bam he is done. Its quite precise, so no overshooting.

With all that, you can approach him. Find the correct way, and you might find him as an affable and friendly guy. He may seem shy from the outside, but he is different if you can interact with him the right way.

## Relations

### [Awu](Awu.md)

These two have been long enough to have a great friendship. Awu has softened up to Flerovy, and do understand the way the latter works. Flerovy on the other hand, also has opened up to Awu.

Since they both are perfectionists, they both work well and get on each other's nerves. Its never neutral or lukewarm, its always extremely hot or extremely cold. But, in the end it doesn't matter as they are still great friends.

One knows knowledge, and the other can remember. Awu can actually take the notes and stuff Flerovy really needs. Flerovy on the other hand can churn out things for Awu even though the Australian Sapphic latter doesn't really do much so.

### [CeRNY](../../Bench/Air%20Conditioners/CeRNY.md) and [SASHuan](SASHuan.md)

These 3 are the perfect partners in science.

CeRNY can do the math, while SASHuan can do the stoichiometry, and Flerovy can do the precise movements of adding the chemicals.

A well-oiled trio they are. CeRNY, SASHuan, and Flerovy, are capable of executing some of the greatest chemical feats (they have ever seen). They know how to handle a lot of crazy things, which may or may not be: `nitrating toluene into TNT`, `handling nitroglycerin`, etc...

They are great at working together, and they have no qualms of animosity. They hang out with each other, cus they great.

## Trivia

- Flerovium is cool, and FV reminds me of that, so ye.
