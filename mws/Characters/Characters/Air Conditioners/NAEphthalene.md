NAEpthalene is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

## Identity

NAEpthalene's name is pronounced as Neptune and Naphthalene. The "NEp" is pronounced as the "Nep" in Neptune, while the "tha" is pronounced as the "tha" in Naphthalene. His name is derived from his model (NE), Naphtha and Naphthalene.

## Personality

> TLDR: Sexist misogynist. Just plain rude in general to men, but very sexist to women. Would try to show why men/male is superior to woman/female. Stubborn and very hard to learn and teach. A total asshole who is a total saddist. How saddist? Not happy if nobody is suffering. He baits for suffering unlike [Avxy](Avxy.md) who baits for fun. Freedom loving and timeout hating.

Misogynistic strawman misogynist of MWS.

NAEpthalene believes that Males like him is superior over females. He believes that men is the greatest sex and gender over anything else. Trans? Nah! Demi? Nah! Man is life for him, everything else is death.

Because of this, NEptha seems rude to non male people. Even if they are nice to him, he rejects them and treats them as slaves. Something tells me that NEptha is still living like in the 1420s. Even with this, he is still slightly rude to male people.

NEptha may need to be taught a lesson on why man is not the superior, but equal to everything. But its hard, because NEptha is quite stubborn at learning even though if he already made mistakes. NEptha thinks lessons are for wimps and weaklings. NEptha is very close-minded in life.

NEptha in general is an asshole. He treats people poorly. He feels that men is superior, and that feeds into him. He does not have a heart of gold, but a heart of jerk. Some of NEptha's antics are like [Avxy](Avxy.md) but worst. He wants to see people suffer. He is a sadist, who is happy from other's suffering. If his antics doesn't cause others to suffer, he is not happy. NEptha would like to bait reactions and pain. Unlike Avxy who just baits reactions for fun, NEptha baits reactions and pain.

NEptha would not be happy if his freedom is restricted. He hates time-outs. NEptha would be the type guy to break out of jail.

NEptha is a stuborn guy who is not nice to anybody.
## Relations

### [Xeo](Xeo.md)
NAEpthalene dislikes Xeo. Its because Xeo is a woman, and just catty.  He doesn't exactly like her overly aggressive behavior. And also NEptha is a freaking sexist.

Well, Xeo also dislikes him cus he's a bastard.

### [JKE](JKE.md)
NAEpthalene sees JKE as a version of himself, a less advanced one. He sees JKE as inferior. Don't worry, he is kinda like a big brother to him (even if JKE is older). NAEpthalene is very supportive to JKE because they are similar.

NAEpthalene and JKE both are aware that they aren't actually siblings.
### [Wheamy](Wheamy.md)
Wheamy finds NAEpthalene more pleasant in comparison to [others](VXU.md#DeltaCXG). He is still not happy with him cus sexism? Bro what? To him thats just a low.
