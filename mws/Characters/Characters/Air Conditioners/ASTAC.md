TLDR: Undogmatic and less stuborn, but still new. less wise, but still quite acceptably wise even for old people standard. Cautious, yet accepting. Prepared for life. 

ASTAC is quite undogmatic despite his age. He is more accepting to new bits in life. Don't think though you can sneak critically nonsense things into life. ASTAC is also quite cautious and prepared for all these kinds of situations where some of these inappropriate things come in. 

ASTAC is also prepared for life. He is quite acceptably wise for his age. He might not be as wise as [CKHSC](CKHSC.md), but he knows his way of life. You can ask him for bits of knowledge of living the high, and he knows his way.
