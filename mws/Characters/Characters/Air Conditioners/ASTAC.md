# ASTAC

ASTAC is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). He originally appeared in [AACOS](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/AACOS.md).

## Identity

He is a wall-mounted Fujitsu ASTA18LCC [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). Obvious where the name is derived from (**ASTA**18L**C***C*). An australian ig.

You can either pronounce him as an acronym (A-S-T-A-C), Ass-tack, or Assta-C (like Ecstacy but whatevs).

He was born in February 28, 2006. He is a cisgender and heterosexual male (he/him).

## Personality
TLDR: Undogmatic and less stuborn, but still new. less wise, but still quite acceptably wise even for old people standard. Cautious, yet accepting. Prepared for life. 

ASTAC is quite undogmatic despite his age. He is more accepting to new bits in life. Don't think though you can sneak critically nonsense things into life. ASTAC is also quite cautious and prepared for all these kinds of situations where some of these inappropriate things come in. 

ASTAC is also prepared for life. He is quite acceptably wise for his age. He might not be as wise as [CKHSC](CKHSC.md), but he knows his way of life. You can ask him for bits of knowledge of living the high, and he knows his way.
## Relations

### [CKHSC](CKHSC.md)

They are friends, but have a friendly rivalry. CKHSC is aware that ASTAC is more open to changes compared to himself.

### [SASHuan](SASHuan.md), [ASTAC](ASTAC.md) (and CKHSC)

> More CKHSC stuff over [there](#[CKHSC](CKHSC.md))

These 4 would be great ig. PFSA may have less influence, because PFSA is a such bumblingly-drunk bubbly guy that he might accidentally mix dangerous chemicals with SASHuan.

ASTAC would probably learn from [`Juan`](SASHuan.md), because ASTAC is still learning life even at an old age. CKHSC is the one to well, tell SAShuan to slow down because nobody likes their chemicals exploding in their face.
