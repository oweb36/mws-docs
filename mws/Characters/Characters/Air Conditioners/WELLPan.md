# WELLPan

WELLPan is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). He originally appeared in [AACOS](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/AACOS.md).

## Identity

WELLPan is a Samsung AS09BPAN wall-mounted [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Well-Pan. His name is derived from the PAN of his species' model name and the *Well equidistributed long-period linear (WELL)* random number generator.

WELLPan was born in July 3, 2005. He is a cisgender and helisexual male (he/him). Yes, he sexually identifies as an Apache Attack Helicopter (Helisexual). This is not a joke (kinda). Also he is not a part of the LGBTQ community, so he is kinda in his own zone along with [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md). 
If skin color matters, he is white.

He is one of the strongest person in the Megarchive Warehouse Show. He is also one of the most intelligent person in MWS. WELLPan is also one of the slowest person in MWS. WELLPan is one of the sanest person in MWS.

WELLPan also [cannot be angry](#Chillsacking). He is unable to feel anger, as his soul and *brain* lacks it in him. Its against the laws of the universe for him to be angry. 

## Personality
TLDR: Chill Guy, Lazy Bum, Smart, Sane. Actually capable, but is lazy. Would like to be your friend if you want. Cannot actually get angry, but still understands anger.

WELLPan is one of the chillest and most easygoing person in the Megarchive Warehouse Show. He is pretty much the easygoing vibe carrier in AACOS. He has that unhinged, yet chill humor. WELLPan is also kinda lazy and unmotivated at times. To get his thin body to do something, you should motivate him.

WELLPan also doesn't really care about his surroundings that much, unless he is actually doing a **NOT SO LAZY** action like idk, **MOVING**? He is very oblivious, but thats only because like I said, he doesn't care about the surroundings. He is very care free. After all, he is lazy and chill to care about the chaos and his surroundings eh? This carefree personality and behavior of WELLPan is the reason why WELLPan is one of the sanest. He doesn't care about the madness, and with that he doesn't let the chaos and insanity of the world bother him to insanity. He deals with his own problems and things, which is very little.

WELLPan is also very nonchalant at even the worst things. He (sometimes good, sometimes bad) treats everything as if its an everyday thing. To him, everything is alright and nothing ever goes wrong. Somebody dies? He treats that as a daily occurence. Somebody commits a war crime? Nah, to him its normal. Mass torture? Everything is alright, torture is normal. Basically he is very calm even at the most egregious things ever done or to happen.

WELLPan is very smart. He is a bookworm. He likes to read a lot. This shows that WELLPan is smart, but is too unmotivated to do things. He can lead and serve as a voice of guidance and leadership to motivate and guide others (his competitors/friends), but only if he is bothered to do so.

WELLPan actually has extreme potential. With his intelligence as mentioned before, he has a lot to offer. The problem? Like I said, very lazy and chill.

WELLPan may struggle with motivation and laziness, but don't underestimate him. He has the potential to win, but he doesn't want to. He is too chill. 

Everyone, well almost everyone likes him because he is easy to get along with. In fact, he would like to be your friend (of course you don't have to accept, and he is fine with this too). He is easy to befriend, and he actually does not take it personally if you turn his offer. So yeah, he is one friend to trust.

And oh also smth! [WELLPan actually cannot get angry](#Chillsacking). His soul and *brain* simply does not have that in him. Even if you try to split his personality into multiples, you won't find anger from it. Its actually against the laws of the universe for him to be angry, so he chill. He still understands anger.

### Chillsacking

WELLPan is very chill. In fact he cannot feel anger at all, literally!

WELLPan's *brain* literally does not have the required [*neural circuits and neural pathways*](void:more-like-electrica-traces) for anger. You won't even find activity even remotely resembling anger! He is just that chill.

In his soul, no anger at all. Not repressed, just not there. He is that chill. Its as if he was formed and born without anger (It is).

Normally when you split someone and their soul into their constituent personalities, you will find anger in some form or capacity, either as the foundation or just another personality. In WELLPan, splitting him the same way and there will be no anger. He does not have anger in him, and you cannot find it anywhere.

Cool fact that makes this guaranteed: It's against the laws of the universe and the laws of physics for him to be angry. The universe enforces this. Try to inject anger into him and it will be rejected and yeeted out. If you do see him display anger in any level, that is ominous as someone clearly has broken the laws of the universe (I hope we don't see this).

## Relations

### [Aurl](Aurl.md)
They are frenemies (at least on Aurl's side), but they are more of a friend that enemies (Enemy is only on Aurl's side). The only conflict that they can be in is in a friendly little competition of who can be the chillest, and WELLPan always wins. They just hang out with each other.

## [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md)
They are typically duos. WELLPan is the chiller in this duo, while ToshyFEN is the more active one. ToshyFEN is the motivator to WELLPan to get him to do something. WELLPan is aware of ToshyFEN's very bad mental health state, and he does whatever he can to keep it under control.

In this duo, they could actually destroy the entire cast of MWS due to their sheer physical strength. ToshyFEN would likely be the one to start it, and he would drag WELLPan into this madness. ToshyFEN would also probably stick WELLPan to his back, and bring him along.

ToshyFEN's meltdown might cause WELLPan to freak out if there's nobody to stop him.

### [AEX](AEX.md)
They are good friends. JHR and WELLPan likes to read books in their spare time together.

PCR and EXMGR also is on good terms. HR is neutral with him, because WELLPan is very chill.

Sometimes WELLPan sees EXMGR's hyperactive social nature as quite too extreme sometimes, which is very true.

### [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md)
They aren't close, but they are there. WELLPan and ToshyMEF are close due to few reasons. One of them is their weird sexuality where WELLPan identifies as an Apache Attack Helicopter and ToshyMEF identifies as an LG TV.

WELLPan knows the slight homophobia of ToshyMEF.

### [ToshyMEM](ToshyMEM.md)
To ToshyMEM in competitions, WELLPan is just dead weight. She may appreciate his presence, but he doesn't really do much. She asks one question: Why you gotta be dead weight, why you are throwing away this chance.

Otherwise, they are chill. No personal beef. WELLPan is too chill for that, and she appreciates it.

### [KaHLium](KaHLium.md)
KaHLium asks one question and says one thing to WELLPan: Why, and also you so chill we can be friends.

He is so befuddled at WELLPan's chilness, lack of seriousness, and [**INANGERABILITY**](void:made-up-word-for-cannot-be-angered). Very confusing and mysterious to this dry guy.

Still can chat. He is friends with this guy, despite him actually confusing him.

### [Aufs](Aufs.md)
They are friends, because they are *SANE* unlike [some](ToshyFEN.md) other people or friends.

WELLPan might question Aufs at times about his behavior of lurking in the dark. He feels something is off when that happens, but he understands about Aufs. WELLPan knows that Aufs is very complicated.

## [Xeo](Xeo.md)

WELLPan is chill. WELLPan is one of the people Xeo has no problems with.

Xeo might snark WELLPan once in a while, but its not **THAT** big of a deal since WELLPan is chill and Xeo has no qualms.

## [Xefa](Xefa.md)

WELLPan is chill. She has no qualms with him.

Not a lot to say.

### [CKHSC](CKHSC.md)

CKHSC: Get yo ass up, WELLPan.
WELLPan: Lemme enjoy my life.
