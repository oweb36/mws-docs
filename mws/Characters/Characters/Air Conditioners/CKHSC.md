# CKHSC

CKHSC is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). He originally appeared in [AACOS](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/AACOS.md).

## Identity

He is a wall-mounted Panasonic CS-E15CKP [air conditioner](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Check-See (CHK-C).

He was born in July 22, 2003. He is a cisgender and heterosexual male (he/him) because he is too old (for him) to be bothered with LGBTQ. A fine englishman. 
If skin color matters, CKHSC is white.

## Personality
TLDR: Wise, old, dogmatic. Unadaptable and closed traditionalist. Believes in and for the collective best.

CKHSC an old person. He is a wise, but quite traditional guy. He is kinda like a grandfather to the MWS cast, but he knows he still needs to learn more about now and that he needs to start adapting.

CKHSC has a lot of experience in life, and so he can tell others who are younger, and sometimes older about life and what can it throw. He basically is kinda like a dictionary, but for life situations and what to do. CKHSC also has stories to tell.

CKHSC also has a few issues. He is a traditionalist, or he likes to stick with his old ways. He can be stubborn at times, but budge him enough and he will relent. This is because he thinks that the old ways are superior compared to the new ones.

Don't worry, CKHSC believes that what he is doing is for the best for everyone. He cares for them. CKHSC also knows that he must learn more about the current world as it has changed a lot and that he must adapt and leave some of his old ways behind that are not suitable for the current world.

## Relations

### [ASTAC](ASTAC.md)
They are friends, but have a friendly rivalry. CKHSC is aware that ASTAC is more open to changes compared to himself.

### [JHR](AEX/JHR.md)
JHR and CKHSC teach each other. They learn from each other about life, and how it changes.

JHR shows CKHSC the way of the modern life. Its the progressive way of living, as CKHSC likes to put it. CKHSC is quite hesistant and resistant to this way, and JHR is aware of it. JHR tries to coax and guide CKHSC to the modern life.

CKHSC shows JHR the way of the traditional life, which would have been lost if it weren't for [CKHSC](CKHSC.md) and the other elders. CKHSC shows JHR the old ways, that is usually trusted and battle-tested.

With the difference in the generations, JHR and CKHSC knows the progression of life.

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)

CKHSC: Get yo ass up, WELLPan.
WELLPan: Lemme enjoy my life.

### [SASHuan](SASHuan.md), [PFSA](PFSA.md) (and ASTAC)

> More [ASTAC](#[ASTAC](ASTAC.md)) there.

These 4 would be great ig. PFSA may have less influence, because PFSA is a such bumblingly-drunk bubbly guy that he might accidentally mix dangerous chemicals with SASHuan.

ASTAC would probably learn from [`Juan`](SASHuan.md), because ASTAC is still learning life even at an old age. CKHSC is the one to well, tell SAShuan to slow down because nobody likes their chemicals exploding in their face.

## Trivia

- He has gotten through one iteration before. The first model was a **CS-CxCKH**, but I changed him since I think he is cooler as an inverter, and there's [less documentation](void:no-operation-manuals-specifically) about the **CS-CxCKH** than the **CS-ExCKP**.
