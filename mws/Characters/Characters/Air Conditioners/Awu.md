# Awu

Awu is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

## Identity

Awu is a Fujitsu AWU18CXQ [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). Her name is pronounced as A-wu, AKA Awu.

She was born in February 10, 2003. She is a sapphic cisgender female (she/her). She likes women basically.

She is white if skin color matters.

## Personality
TLDR: Perfectionist. Show-offer braggart for superior model of her time. Inside is gold compared to the outside braggartness. Dirt digger and blackmailer of victims who doesn't care about what they looked up.

Quiet perfectionist. She does not show off or express her perfectionism.  Awu might get irritated if plans don't go well or its too *imperfect*. She wants the best and perfect method for everything!

Awu is also the kind of girl to blackmail you. She would dig dirt on you. She knows what you did, and she would use it against you. You might ask if she cares about what you have, and no.

She takes pride silently as a high end model of her time. Her feeling of superiority as a high end model of her time though subtly shapes her actions towards others, and at times she might not even realize it. One such subtle action is she demonstrating her features to others without her realizing it. Awu is silently confident, and that can help you!

Awu despite her outer personality, is soft and approachable. You just need to be with her long enough to see this side. She intently listen to others and provides thoughtful support to others.
