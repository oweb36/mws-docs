She is a Toshiba wall-mounted MMK-AP0124MHP-E1 [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). Her named is pronounced as Toh-she-mem. Her name is unique as its not based of her model name, but based of her species's brand and unrelated words (Toshy from Toshiba, MEM from somewhere).

## Personality

TLDR: Fierce and competitive. Determined and ruthless. Ignores every obstacle as if there's none on her path. She might manipulate or even force others. Yeah, she's very ruthless. Well she wants to win her goals and dreams. Pushy to others, and might strain beyond capabilities.

She is a pretty fierce contestant and competitor. She has some strong perseverance and filled with determination, characterized by her relentless drive to win the show! ToshyMEM is also fairly careful at challenges and life in general. ToshyMEM is very competitive and she will stop at nothing to win the show, not even others sometimes. 

She may manipulate others to win and advance her, but only if she has to. She's not a sociopath you know, she has feelings too. ToshyMEM will push herself and others to the limits to win. ToshyMEM may also even push the others beyond their limit, which may be lower than her own. This can create tensions between others as her intense focus on winning may cause relationships to strain with others. This straining occurs because ToshyMEM may be ruthless or overly competitive in winning towards others.


## Relations

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)
To ToshyMEM in competitions, WELLPan is just dead weight. She may appreciate his presence, but he doesn't really do much. She asks one question: Why you gotta be dead weight, why you are throwing away this chance.

Otherwise, they are chill. No personal beef. WELLPan is too chill for that, and she appreciates it.
