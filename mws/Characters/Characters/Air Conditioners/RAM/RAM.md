RaiileRaiile# RAM

RAM is a [character](Characters.md) as a competitor/contestant (mostly [Raiilee](Raiilee.md)) on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

RAM is a multi-split system (or as Hitachi would like to refer to as: The `MultiZone`).
## Identity

RAM is a multi-split system consisting of [Raiilee](Raiilee.md), [RADStler](RADStler.md), and [RAMH](RAMH.md). So, RAM is a RAD-25NH7, and a RAI-25NH5 unit connected to a RAM-130QH5.

RAMH unlike [VXU](../VXU/VXU.md) and [AEX](../AEX/AEX.md), isn't a collective but instead are siblings who are one together (like conjoined twins). This means that RAM is just a plain collective, not a collective entity. Due to this, RAM is referred to as they/them.

RAM's birth is considered to be April 20, 2004, when Raiie, RADStler, and RAMH was joined together first. Their members members may be older or younger, but we take RADStler's birth for this.

While RAM's members come from different places, RAM is still English because they all have English [`'blood'`](void:refrigerant) in them.
