RAMH is pax.

RAMH is also a gaymar sweat, always doing things hard. Quite serious at doing things, he try to speedrun it. He's competitive, but for the wrong reasons. Just want to be there first, not be the best. He is very out of pocket with this, acting as if everything is a COD lobby.

Also he is funny ig. Quite a gangsta. Humor is insane, a total joke, and completely outa-pocket.
## Relations

### [ToshyMEM](../ToshyMEM.md)

Oh, these two are head-to-head. Sweat vs Competitive

Who would win? IDK! But these two are capable of outmatching each other. Very close in competitions, and ranks.
