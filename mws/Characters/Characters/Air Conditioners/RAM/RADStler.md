# RADStler

RADStler is a [character](Characters.md) as a competitor (alongside [Raiilee](Raiilee.md)) on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). RADStler just kinda goes along with  (the main one).
## Identity

RADStler is a Hitachi RAD-25NH7 ducted [heat pump](../../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). RADStler is a pretty complete ducted unit since he has an SPX-RCK2 wireless remote control kit installed in him alongside his standard wired remote controller.

RADStler doesn't exactly have a skin color, since he is a bare ducted unit. What we can see though are his wired and wireless remote controllers. Smth special is that RADStler is both from the UK's England and the USA's Texas.

RADStler is siblings with [Raiilee](Raiilee.md) and [RAMH](RAMH.md) as a multi-split installation ([RAM](RAM.md)). RADStler is yet also siblings with [TERAS](../TERAS.md) and [RACK](../RACK.md).

RADStler was born in April 20, 2007. He is male (he/him).

## Personality
> TLDR: Chillax Functional Crackpot
> TLDR2: Chill flow, go with the flow and stream
> TLDR3: IDC, I am just following you and having fun ig

He is that one guy who is always with the flow, but also a Crackpot (albeit functional).

He is a flow guy, always following the stream. Basically wherever the stream goes, he follows. He is quite chill about it, having no qualms about it! Doesn't care about anything, and is just always having fun. An absolute NPC follower.

RADStler is also a crackpot, but functional. He is not eccentric, but foolish. He absolutely has no education, but still can speak and communicate. Its unknown how he does so, but what we know is he literally can only do elementary math.
