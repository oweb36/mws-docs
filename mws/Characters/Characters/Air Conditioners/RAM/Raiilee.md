# Raiilee

Raiilee is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). He originally appeared in [AACOS](../../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/AACOS.md) with a different name.

## Identity

He is a Hitachi RAI-25NH5 4-way cassette [heat pump](../../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Rai-lee.

He was born on June 6, 2005. He is a pansexual genderfluid person. Raiilee prefers to be male (he/him), but Raiilee will change if he has too when the circumstances and situation warrants it (such as male persecution), AKA mutogender.

[Raiilee](Raiilee.md), [RAMH](RAMH.md), and [RADStler](RADStler.md) are siblings, and one multi-split installation ([RAM](RAM.md)) alongside [RAMH](RAMH.md). [RACK](../RACK.md) is considered as an elder sibling to them. Raiilee is kinda dragging RADStler and RAMH along with the, but they are okay with that.

English.

If skin color matters, he is white.
## Personality

TLDR: Good negotiator. Would try to compromise if he can for the good of both sides in a dispute. He is a mediator for his siblings due to his skills and knows their sweet spot.

Raiilee is a skilled negotiator. He can negotiate things with others. He knows what he is doing, and the sweet spot. You need help with negotiations? Get Raiilee.

Raiilee also likes to compromise if he can. This is so that both can get the best of both world. This proves that Raiilee does things for the benefit of both sides. Yes he does! Raiilee does things the way he does to benefit both sides. He is benevolent after all.

Raiilee is also the mediator between [TERAS](../TERAS.md) and [RACK](RACK.md) because of his negotiation skills. Raiilee would figure out their sweet spots for everything.

## Relations

### [TERAS](../TERAS.md)

TERAS is the younger brother to Raiilee. TERAS pranks Raiilee almost all the time. Raiilee finds it funny, but annoying. Raiilee sees TERAS as an unsupervised toddler.

### [RACK](RACK.md)

Well, RACK actually respects Raiilee because the latter can actually convince him.

### [Awu](../Awu.md)

Idk what these two would do, but umm these two are friends. Awu has shown her good side to Raiilee, and Raiilee is not the one to abuse it.

Awu would sometimes ask Raiilee to be a mediator in some cases.

## Trivia

- He is the first cassette I believe. Even Raiilee predates [RAM](RAM.md), probably because I discovered later on that Raiilee is indeed a multi-only unit.
