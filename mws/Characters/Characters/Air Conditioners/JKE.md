# JKE

JKE is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). He originally appeared in [AACOS](../../../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/AACOS.md).

## Identity

He is a Panasonic wall-mounted CS-CE12JKE-1 [heat pump](../../Species/Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Jay-Kay-Ee, or Jake, though he prefers the first one.

He is ([mostly](NAEphthalene.md)) unique from other Panasonics in that his power lamp also acts as a deice lamp. He would go to deice mode when the area he is currently in is too cold. His power/deice lamp is normally green (not deice), but blue in deicing mode.

He was born in June 14, 2010. He is a cisgender and heterosexual male.

If skin color matters, JKE is gray.

## Personality
TLDR: Two modes/Two-sided. One side is chatty and hyperactive ranter who can't keep his mouth shut (with secret spilling moments) and is always moving and stimming about. Other side is chill and passive, silent. These sides depend on his deice/defrosting state.

He is a very chatty and hyperactive person. He will rant about a lot of things. Yap and babble he will! Anything, he can't keep his mouth shut. Whatever you do, don't share secrets with him as he would probably share it to others. He is also hyperactive and energetic, stimming and running about. He is basically like a little child on a sugar rush.

That is when he is not in deice mode (Indicated by his power/deice lamp being green). When he is in deice mode (power/deice lamp is blue), he is a different person. He is less active and chiller. He would not do all those things when he isn't in deice mode. He just listens, as he is passive. No talking from him, at all.

This means that to keep him chill, just put him in very icy and snowy environment. He will deice himself and then the process of passivity begins.

## Relations

### [Xeo](Xeo.md)
Xeo sees JKE as an inferior version of herself. She does not like him. She would talk shit about him, being inferior.

Crap talks of Xeo: "You ain't deluxe," "Why so small?"

You get it.

### [NAEphthalene (NEptha)](NAEphthalene.md)
NAEpthalene sees JKE as a version of himself, a less advanced one. He sees JKE as inferior. Don't worry, he is kinda like a big brother to him (even if JKE is older). NAEpthalene is very supportive to JKE because they are similar.

NAEpthalene and JKE both are aware that they aren't actually siblings.
