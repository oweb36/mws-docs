### Names

To recap, here are his names:
- PKayFsa -> Pee-Kay-Visa (Real name)
- PFSA -> Pee-Visa (Nickname condensed and distilled from real name)

## Personality

TLDR: Drunk bubbly "old" guy. Caring and helpful with his resources. Easily distracted and needs guidance. He is older than the wise but ironically is unwise. Still learning life. Why all this? Because his brain is still considered a "children's" brain and hence he is a child in an old adult body.

He is kinda drunk, but not rlly (This is referencing the Pee-Kay of his real name which means drunk in some hindi language).

He is quite bubbly and umm not that sharp in his mind. He is quite caring though, and will try to help you with what he has. PFSA may get distracted with things though, and you should probably guide him with what topic is he talking about.

PFSA may not have the intelligence of [CKHSC](CKHSC.md) and [ASTAC](ASTAC.md) but he will try. The irony is that PFSA is older than them. He is still learning, and will use what he experienced on advising others. He may get distracted though.

Something is not right with his "brain" though as for his age he is still a child. But yeah, he is pretty much a child in an old body.
