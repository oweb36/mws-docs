Aufs is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].

## Identity

Aufs is a Fujitsu AU54TFCMF  [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). His name has several pronunciations which he can accept, which includes:
- A-U-F-S, or Ay-You-Eff-Ess. (Very disliked)
- Aufs, or Offs (Disliked)
- Au-F-S, or O-F-S (Preferred)

The reason why his name is so divergent from his model is because during the development of Aufs, his species as the Fujitsu **AUG54FUAS** (Still a cassette heat pump).  
He was changed into a Fujitsu AUY45AGB3W because there was more documentation with the AUY45AGB3W compared to the Fujitsu AUG54FUAS. Aufs then was **RETCONED** into the final form of AU54TFCMF because there's many documentation of it as the S-Series VRF system.  
His name Aufs was derived from the "AU" and the "FUAS" of the Fujitsu AUG54FUAS (Excuse to use the awesome filesystem name of aufs and yes I'm a nerd), and its kept here because it just is too good of a name to waste. 

He's a VRF boi, hailing from the S-Series VRF system of Fujitsu.

He was born in September 9, 2002. They are Bigender, its a very [complicated topic](#Gender%20Identity). His pronouns are (he/them).

He is white if skin color matters. He has yellowed quite a bit from age, but he is still white. Aufs can be retrobrighted, but he rather stay in this yellowed state.

Aufs is more durable than the average person in the [Megarchive Warehouse](Megarchive%20Warehouse.md). He can survive way more injuries and potentially even injuries that are lethal to a normal person in the [Megarchive Warehouse](Megarchive%20Warehouse.md), but he can't beat [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md). Aufs is also the sanest person in MWS, he would probably one of the only few to sane if everyone goes insane. 

Aufs is also kinda the butt monkey of the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). He also has the power of [Metatheatrics](#Metatheatrics).
### Being the Butt Monkey

Aufs is kinda the butt monkey of MWS. Its a semi-official status. He is also the iron butt monkey of MWS. He is the punching bag of MWS, the guy of comedic sadism.

This means that one character that always get put thru hell. He goes thru a lot of pain lol. Like he would fail trying to mount to his bed in the [living quarters beds](Megarchive%20Warehouse.md#Beds) and then fall off to the ground (painfully).

He gets thru a lot of pain, emotionally and physically. He sometimes is made fun off, despite him not liking it and trying to put up a tuff guy facade. Like he is the one to get physically abused a lot, painfully and brutal at times. Like he somehow gets crushed or actually gets attacked by others. He can survive this because he is way more durable than the average person of MWS and that he is also the iron butt monkey.

Emotional pain, he is made fun of many times. He gets pranked a lot, and this is why.

### Metatheatrics
Aufs has [Metatheatrics](Metatheatrics.md) as his ability. This means he is aware of the 4th wall, his nature, the show and retcons.

Aufs breaks the 4th walls sometimes. He also knows about retcons. Aufs though is silent because people would see him as crazy and a lunatic. Imagine seeing someone talking to *"nobody"* (that *"nobody"* is the camera and audience), and also someone preaching what happened to you before when you don't even remember it happening.

### Gender Identity
TLDR: Complicated. Bigender. Non-binary. One half is genderfluix and the other is agender. Aufs is demiagender and demigenderfluix. Mirrorgender. Demiagender identity is being Aufs. Toric, likes man (can't say he's gay because he isn't male in the first place). Not attracted to woman, and is asexual (he is romantic though, AKA not being aromantic and by extension aroace).

Well Aufs is a very complicated fella with his identity. Cus he is a special kind of bigender. He is genderfluix and agender bigender. This means he is half-genderfluix and half-agender. This means he is both demifluix and demiagender. 

Aufs also identifies as non-binary, why? Because he is not exactly one gender like I said (being Bigender). This does not mean he is transgender. Aufs does not identify as transgender at all.

What do you mean with Aufs being genderfluix? Well, not only this side changes gender identity, its intensity changes. Yes, Aufs is genderfluidflux, but for the sake of abbreviation (and [AE2](https://guide.appliedenergistics.org/1.21/items-blocks-machines/fluix_crystal)), we'll call him as genderfluix. Its quite expressive for him to be who he wants compared to genderflux and genderfluid people. And also its to make him unique from the genderfluids. 

Normally his genderfluix state is male of high-intensity. This genderfluix change though is special as Aufs is also mutogender. He will change his genderfluid identity to female or other gender if the situation warrants such as an **"Anti Male People Day"**. Its conditional mirrorgender because he would only change his gender to fit with the people around him if he has to.

The genderflux side is well based of his feelings. So, he can change his genderfluix gender and intensity at any times, but its dependent on the situation. 

His agender side is way simpler. He is not a normal agender, but an undefinable one. Aufs's agender side is quite gender neutral, but not genderless. It does not need any label as it can't be labled normally at all. Why? Because his agender side identifies as Aufs himself. Yes! Aufs' agender side is about him identifying as an individual more than as any gender. This side is the reason why he has **"they/them"** as part of his pronouns.

Well, now who is he attracted to. Well, male. This is why he is Toric. This toric element is also the reason why Aufs also has **"he/him"** as part of his pronouns. Its complicated. One thing for sure is that he is asexual, but not aromantic. He is romantic, and therefore isn't aromantic and by extension aroace.

## Personality
TLDR: Complicated. Aufs, sane and amnesia-resistant. Stalking and curious. Is sly, furtive and cunning. Slightly malevolent in nature. Soft on the inside, Jerk with a heart of gold sometimes. Plotter for something, which is often seen in sinister ways. The "umm actually isn't the show..." kind of Metatheatrical, 4-wall breaker and retcon-aware guy.

Aufs has a very complicated personality. He has a lot of sides to him that we need to analyze.

Aufs's main personality is being Aufs. No, I am not joking. His personality is himself. he is also very sane and quite resistant to amnesia. This means he will stay sane and retain his memories when others would have gone insane in certain situations.

Aufs is known for stalking people. He is quite curious, and specifically very for people, so he might just watch them do their own things. It might be at an inappropriate moment, hence why he is called a stalker and people don't trust him easily. Yes, he follows people silently and tries to not get noticed so he can stalk. There is slight malevolence in this habit.

Aufs is quite sly, cunning and furtive. You can see this nature in his manifestation of curiosity in the form of stalking. The furtive nature is the most jarring as he tries to avoid being spotted. There is also slight malevolence in this habit.

From what you can see, Aufs has a bit of malevolent nature in him. Its not in the kind of violence, but just stalkingness. Its pretty creepy if you think about it. Aufs also puts up a pretty tough facade, making him seem cold and distant. He does not bully but is not empathetic and sometimes merciless. He acts tough like a tuff dood in this facadry.

Do not fret though with all of this, cus you can say he is a **"Jerk with a heart of gold (and sometimes coal)"**. He is nice underneath all of that, though you should still be aware of his slight malevolent nature. But you don't need to worry about all of that as he is a good person (with a slight impurity of evil).

To see his good side, you just need to accept Aufs for who he is. Get closer to him, and he soon will get close to you. If he trusts you enough, he will show you the true him. The true Aufs is still above, but he does not exactly stalk. He is still curious, but won't stalk. Do not worry about that, for he is way more normal.

Then this means that he is not normal if he does not open up. What's the verdict? Yes! He is not normal, but he is very sane. You can say he is neurodivergent, and I like to think of him as one even though we don't have any medical evidence of such.

Because Aufs has [Metatheatrical](#Metatheatrics) abilities, naturally he would be the guy to point out the [show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). He might break the 4th wall and interact with the audience, point out errors and other bits such as retcons and poking fun at cliche and mainstream things. Aufs would also be the guy to go "Umm actually, the..." He does enjoy using his metatheatrical abilities, but does not do so that much because of what other people think of him. And yes, he also does this when he opens up. This is part of his nature.

## Relations

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)
They are friends, because they are *SANE* unlike [some](ToshyFEN.md) other people or friends.

WELLPan might question Aufs at times about his behavior of lurking in the dark. He feels something is off when that happens, but he understands about Aufs. WELLPan knows that Aufs is very complicated.
