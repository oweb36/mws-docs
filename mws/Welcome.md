# MWS: Welcome!

This Obsidian Vault is the official documentation and stuff for the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

This show is written and created by MXPSQL Server 20953 Onetechguy. Its still a concept, but its a big one. A **VERY VERY BIG** one that has a **VERY BIG** scope that is **VERY BIG** and encompasses may ideas and concepts.

This Obsidian Vault is a migration from the former TiddlyWiki notetaking wiki software, as I find this nicer.

> To the Web Viewers:
> This vault is best viewed using obsidian. The 11ty website might be slightly broken, but I am trying my best to make it usable. And also the digital garden.
> 
> A lot of the things, especially trivia has some First-POV writing. The I in this case refers to the author (AKA MXPSQL).
