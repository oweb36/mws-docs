The Megarchive Warehouse is the place where the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md) takes place in. It also acts as the living space, and home for the [characters](../../Characters/Characters.md) of the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md); the [characters](../../Characters/Characters.md)  of [MWS](../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md) are the residents of the [Megarchive Warehouse](.md).

Its just your warehouse of products and parts. There are parts and showcase like appliances such as [air conditioners](../../Characters/Species/Air%20Conditioners.md), [washing machines](../../Characters/Species/Washing%20Machines.md), [refridgerators](../../Characters/Species/Refridgerators.md) and etc. The warehouse also has a comprehensive library and index for the residents to use. The living quarters is where they spend most of their time.

The warehouse is not the most futuristic, because they don't have a lot to go with. They just have enough money to do well and survive a nice life, but not enough for a savvy and luxurious life. Everyone who is a resident is ok though as everything is alright. This is why some of the furnitures and appliances aren't so new, but instead old.

## Parts and Showcase

This is where we can see all the air conditioners, fridges, washing machine and more appliances that the warehouse holds. We can see a live demo here.

There is also a section dedicated to parts, stored as crates in shelves. They are pretty heavy, so its a hazard to drop them. These parts can be used to repair damaged appliances.

## Library and Index
The Library is a library for the residents of the warehouse to use. The library is big and comprehensive. It houses the manuals and documentation about all the appliances shown in the warehouse, and the [residents](../../Characters/Characters.md) of the warehouse. The library also contains life history and documentation of the residents.

The Index is used to allow the residents and visitors of the warehouse to find their way around the warehouse. It acts like a map.

The library is accessed by a small computer with a chute for receiving and giving back books. Its fully autonomous.

## Living Quarters
The living quarters is the place where the [residents](../../Characters/Characters.md) mostly spend their time on. Its where they sleep and live together. 

There's a kitchen, which is pretty much useless to all the residents, except AngelSaph. AngelSaph is the only one who needs to consume food. AngelSaph has all the food to himself.

There's a sunroof somewhere here for everyone to peek at the sky.

### Beds
There's also an array of bed, with outlets for the residents to plug in for the night. Each bed is personalized and customized to each of them. So the [air conditioners](../../Characters/Species/Air%20Conditioners.md) beds are tailored to them, while the [washing machines](../../Characters/Species/Washing%20Machines.md) also have tailored beds, and etc...

Basically its personalized in the way they are going to be mounted typically. For washing machines, they are on the floor. For wall mounted bois, they are on the wall like how they are mounted normally. Ceiling cassette bois? On the ceiling they sleep and mount.

There are stairs to facilitate those cassette bois. People like [RACK](../../Characters/Characters/Air%20Conditioners/RACK.md), [ToshySMUT](../../Characters/Characters/Air%20Conditioners/ToshySMUT.md) and [Aufs](../../Characters/Characters/Air%20Conditioners/Aufs.md) needs a ladder to reach their bed, as they are on the ceiling. 

### Computer Lab
There's a computer lab that they can use. The computer lab is a part of the living quarters. Its pretty ancient as it only consists of a Macintosh iici, Macintosh Performa 557, Power Macintosh 6100 Macintosh Color Classic. Their server is an old 2003 HP Pavilion a367c running Windows XP and custom software for interfacing with the macs (This server funnily enough is the newest computer they could afford). This computer network is known as the *Macintosh Network*. The *Macintosh Network* is the primary computer network for the Megarchive Warehouse, aka the head network to rule the other computer networks. Everyone resident of the warehouse prefers to use macs over others except those who have a *TRS-80 Model 100* portable computer.

There's also *TRS-80 Model 100* stations for connecting a *TRS-80 Model 100* portable computer to the Macintosh Network. These stations are used for interfacing a *TRS-80 Model 100* computer with the Macintosh Network to transfer files, play games, connect to the internet or join a chatbox which they otherwise can't do on their own. The stations are connected to the *Macintosh Network* as the *TRS180* Network. The *TRS180* Network and stations are useful for people who have a *TRS-80 Model 100* portable computer such as [](../../Characters/Characters/Air%20Conditioners/AEX/AEX.md#JHR) and [Vista](../../Characters/Characters/Air%20Conditioners/Vista.md). 

Another set of computer also forms a new network known as the *DOS Network*. It's a network primarily used for running DOS programs and games. Though it says it's a DOS network, it also has Windows laptops (but its Windows 9x, so it's still DOS). Its composed of 5 Compaq LTE 5400 Model 2160 laptops, and 4 Toshiba 490CDT laptops. Its powerful, but yes the residents prefer macs over this normally. This network is connected to the *Macintosh Network* as the *DOS Network*.

Their choices of computers aren't ideal because they are on a tight budget and don't have a lot of money, but this ancient deal is a good deal. This is why the Megarchive Warehouse uses old computers such as the Macintosh series of computers, the *TRS-80 Model 100* portable computers and a Windows XP server.

What can they do in a network? They can transfer files, play games, connect to and browse the internet or join a chatbox. Its limited, but useable. They can transfer files for document reasons, or browse the internet to keep up with the news. The games they play are more like battle royale and social deduction games. One game they play is a stripped down version of **Among Us** and **Minecraft**.

So in a nutshell, they got old computers as their computer lab. There's the *Macintosh Network*, *TRS180 Network* and the *DOS Network*. The *Macintosh Network* is the primary network, where all other networks are secondaries connected to it. Everyone resident prefers macintoshes except those who owns a *TRS-80 Model 100*.
### RSR

A door that leads to a magical and mysterious room is present. The door is unique in the way it opens, and there is a sign that reads "Repair, Service and Recovery" on top of it. This magic room is the room where the [residents](../../Characters/Characters.md) get recovered in when they die.  
A keyboard and a monitor is also next to the RSR room. This is where the other residents punch in the name of their dead friends to recover.

The RSR can also repair injuries. It's useful, but rarely used. This injury healing feature is so rarely used that almost everyone forgot about the existence of this feature.
