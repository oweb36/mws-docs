# [NAEphthalene](../../Characters/Characters/Air%20Conditioners/NAEphthalene.md)'s Viewer-Submitted Crackpot Games

NAEphthalene's own [spinoff](../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md) show where he hosts games submitted by you! Its an extremely batshit-level slapstick and sadistic jackass show.

'Its extremely crackpot and meta due to the content and viewer involvement.

## Premise

The IRL Viewers submit games to [NAEphthalene](../../Characters/Characters/Air%20Conditioners/NAEphthalene.md). The games are full of joke and meme, but also full of sadism, violence, and slapstick. We are encouraged to be creative, unpredictable, sadistic, and fourth-wall breaking.

NAEphtlaene selects the best submissions, and then roasts the chosen ones before using them. Contestants play whatever was chosen, and there is a lot of pain. We are sadists who want Schadenfreude.

## Members

Crew and Players are here:

```dataview
TABLE
NVSCG as "NVSCG Membership"
WHERE NVSCG
SORT NVSCG
```

It's clear which Player is willing and which is not based on their personality.  
Also this is not **EXACTLY Fixed** as there are some characters that may or may not join for each game, but here are the core members ig.
