He's not mentally ok, so its fun to see what happens!

### What if FEN is normal

Well, FEN being normal would just make him chill. FEN being normal, aka having no mental health conditions would be FEN without the unhinged side.

FEN would also be more intelligent. FEN would also observe more intently.

This situation assumes that RBC is mentally well.

### What if RBC is mentally unwell

If RBC is mentally unwell like FEN, he wouldn't be the physical attacker but instead the emotional attacker. RBC would literally yell out very offensive and inappropriate word every second. Its pretty damming and nasty as it would cause **EMOTIONAL DAMAGE** to those who hears it. What makes it even worse is that because RBC knows about them thru his intent observation, he would use his knowledge of their not so nice moments against them. He is now constantly angry and irritated.

RBC's intelligence wouldn't falter at all. He is still intelligent, but just politically incorrect.

FEN can't really do much to stop it completely, but he has power as the dominant mind. FEN can literally make him shut up.

This situation assumes that FEN is mentally well.

### What if Both RBC and FEN is not **OKIE DOKIE**

Well, we got an unhinged dood with a *racial slur yeeting* tiny dood. So you get chased by a manic and angry unwell mental hospital patient as you are being chased by yet another mentally unwell *racial slur yeeting* mental hospital patient.

FEN would probably constantly triggered by RBC's constsant *racial slur yeeting*.
