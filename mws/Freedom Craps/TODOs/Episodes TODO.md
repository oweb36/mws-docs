## TODO

- [ ] ## Episode 2
	
	Pre-show:
	
	9/11 joke. **THEY HIT THE TOWERS AGAIN** with (almost) everyone freaking out before [NEptha](../../Characters/Characters/Air%20Conditioners/NAEphthalene.md) says that it must have been a women pilot. [Aufs](../../Characters/Characters/Air%20Conditioners/Aufs.md) is wacthing (quite creepy), before someone notices him and then he says "And I will always be a villain, hoehoehoehoehoe" and finally he dissapears into the dark.
- [ ] Rewrite Episode 1.
