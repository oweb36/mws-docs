GiSY is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]]. He originally appeared in [[AACOS]].


## Identity

She is a wall-mounted Sharp AH-AP12GSY [air conditioner](Air%20Conditioners.md). Her name is pronounced Jee-See and her name is derived from the GSY portion of her species.

She was born in 2008. She is a pansexual demigirl (she/they).

If skin color mattered, she is white.

## Personality
GiSY is an optimist. She always looks to the bright side of life, no matter the conditions. This may be annoying to others who may be realists. GiSY is always trying to bring people's hopes and motivations up, even if they are not realistic. She just wants to make people happy you know that right?

GiSY also is a very kind and gentle demigirl. She's out there to care and nurture others. She may even try to teach and train her fellow friends on how to live, and survive. She also tries to nurture kindness, but that doesn't always works on some [sociopathic](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) people.

GiSY also can get hurt easily emotionally. She's very sensitive due to her nature. If she's hurt, then GiSY may recede and withdraw from society. Misunderstanding her is one way to hurt her.

GiSY is quite forgiving at least. She will forget any past harm, conflict and insults thrown to her or others. She forgives others and just wants to be friends. She may even forget the harm and others had done to her that causes her to isolate herself, and even forgive the perpetrators. This can be against some of her peers, who are less forgiving much to their frustration.

## Relations

### [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG)

[DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG) is the one who likes to bully GiSY. He knows that GiSY is sensitive, and he still does it. He just wants to feel her pain. DeltaCXG wants to be a sadist towards this poor soul who just wants to make the world a better place.

A pesk- ```I mean helpful``` fellow sibling of DeltaCXG (or [VXU](VXU.md)), [MXU](#MXU) is the reason why this bullying is not happening everyday. DeltaCXG would actually try to hurt GiSY, but MXU has been intervening in all of these cases, much to DeltaCGX's chargin and GiSY's ```help me pls idk the vocab pls```. MXU would intervene by walking away.

MXU is not always succesful in intervention though. DeltaCXG has hurt GiSY few times. DeltaCXG has said very nasty and demoralizing things to GiSY before MXU could intervene by walking away. 

DeltaCXG also has actually assaulted her succesfully, resulting in injuries to GiSY. He once punched and struck her so hard, he managed to crack her body. Yeah, DeltaCXG actually hits demigirls, and is a women beater (probably). Not that it matters though.

### [MHeLy](MHeLy.md)

They are good friends. MHeLy and GiSY's caring nature pairs them together. They would work together to not only care, but make the world a better place for everyone.

They are very happy together. They aren't a couple though. MHeLy is not a lesbian or LGBTQ in nature alright?
