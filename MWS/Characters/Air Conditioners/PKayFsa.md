He was born in 1997. He is a cisgender and heterosexual male.
## Personality

He is kinda drunk, but not rlly (This is referencing the Pee-Kay which means drunk in some hindi language).

He is quite bubbly and umm not that sharp in his mind. He is quite caring though, and will try to help you with what he has. PKayFsa may get distracted with things though, and you should probably guide him with what topic is he talking about.

PKayFsa may not have the intelligence of [CKHSC](CKHSC.md) and [ASTAC](ASTAC.md) but he will try. The irony is that PKayFsa is older than them. He is still learning, and will use what he experienced on advising others. He may get distracted though.
