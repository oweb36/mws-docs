ToshyMEF is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].
## Identity
She is a Toshiba MMF-AP0151H floor standing [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). Her name is pronounced as Toh-She-Mef.

She was born in April 6, 2005. She is a TV-sexual cisgendered-female (she/her). She is TV-sexual because she's attracted to LG TVs, as she finds LG TVs better than LGBTQ. Well, at least LG TVs can handle 4k and many colors, unlike LGBTQ with its 6-colored flag (why am I doing this).

If skin color mattered, ToshyMEF is white.

ToshyMEF is the older sister to [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md). They almost look similar except to their controller, where ToshyFEN has the newer one.
