This is a large object show that encompasses older object show of mine such as [[AACOS]] and others. Its based of my megarchive manual archives and collections. This show is part of the larger umbrella of ObjecWeb36.

This show is both competition and slice-of-life based.

The abbreviation for this show is MWS. MVS is a common type of the abbreviation for MWS.

The show that it encompasses is:
- [[AACOS]]
- Some parts of an old part of old ObjectWeb36.

The name Megarchive in both MWS and my megarchive manual collections is a portmanteau of *Mega* and *Archive*.
