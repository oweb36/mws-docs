Episodes are slices of lifes and competition action for the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](../Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show/Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).  
They show what happens in some time-span.

Some of these episodes are competitions, while some may be slices of lifes. There may be even a single episode split into two halves (A and B) with each half being competition and slices of lifes respectively.
