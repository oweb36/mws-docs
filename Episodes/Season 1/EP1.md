This is the first [Episodes](Episodes/Episodes.md) of MWS. 


## Nutshell

Everyone is seen living their life, when suddenly JHR decides to propose a competition. He will be the one to host it. What do they do? Bet and stake things (JHR won't as he's the host, and he won't be a part of the bet).

## Plot
Its a day in the [Megarchive Warehouse](Megarchive%20Warehouse.md). Everyone is enjoying the day (foreshadowing).

We see the kitchen of the warehouse. Its empty, except that [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md) is there. He is eating bread after he fought [Piss](Piss.md). [JHR](JHR.md) then comes to the kitchen because he wants to smalltalk with AngelSaph. After the smalltalk is done, AngelSaph goes out of the living quarters to the outside.

We then get a shot back at the living quarters. Then we hear screaming from the outside. [Wheamy](Wheamy.md) (outside) is yelling: **"OH GA MAWD! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG)??? YOU CAN'T JUST KILL PEOPLE RANDOMLY OUT OF NOWHERE FOR NO REASON!!!"** 

**TBC**
