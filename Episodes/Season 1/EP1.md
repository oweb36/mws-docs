This is the first [Episodes](Episodes/Episodes.md) of MWS. 


## Nutshell

Everyone is seen living their life, when suddenly JHR decides to propose a competition. He will be the one to host it. What do they do? Bet and stake things (JHR won't as he's the host, and he won't be a part of the bet).

## Plot
Its a day in the [Megarchive Warehouse](Megarchive%20Warehouse.md). Everyone is enjoying the day (foreshadowing).

We see the kitchen of the warehouse. Its empty, except that [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md) is there. He is eating bread after he fought [Piss](Piss.md). [JHR](JHR.md) then comes to the kitchen because he wants to smalltalk with AngelSaph. After the smalltalk is done, AngelSaph goes out of the living quarters to the outside.

We then get a shot back at the living quarters. Not many peope are chilling, doing their everyday agendas. [Wheamy](Wheamy.md) is doing nothing and just day dreaming. [WELLPan](WELLPan.md) is reading while [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md) is watching him. JHR is using the computer lab to browse the internet. [Xefa](Xefa.md) is fighting with [JVXH](JVXH.md) while [Xeo](Xeo.md) is also fighting with [RXe](RXe.md), and they are fighting over who is the best lesbian couple.

[Wheamy](Wheamy.md) then goes outside to run some errands (AKA looking for parts) and then we hear screaming from the outside. Wheamy (outside) is yelling: **"OH GA MAWD! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG)??? YOU CAN'T JUST KILL AND INJURE PEOPLE RANDOMLY OUT OF NOWHERE FOR NO REASON!!!"** 

Everyone from the living quarters goes outside and sees the carnage that DeltaCXG had done. We see its not a nice sight to behold. We see that [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md) was crushed to death by DeltaCXG with a crate. He's not the only victim though. DeltaCXG had also injured and killed many others.

DeltaCXG says to Wheamy: "Guess what? Some are dead and I will be adding more! What will you do about it?" Wheamy the continues: "Watch me recover them, you murderer!" and also says to [MXU](VXU.md#MXU): "Man, you need to step up your game! You are too slow to protect anybody from DeltaCXG, even with your power of mobility!" DeltaCXG, provoked from what Wheamy says, punches him. That's another victim of today that is added to DeltaCXG.

JHR then gives a sigh that has a "*here we go again*" vibes and drags Wheamy, injured back into the living quarters. Wheamy then uses the RSR of the living quarters to recover the murdered victims of DeltaCXG. Nothing he can do for the injured victims of DeltaCXG, including himself. So they have to deal with it. Wheamy then decides to rest and recover in the living quarters.


**TODO: MORE CARNAGE**

[ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md) finally had to step in and subdue DeltaCXG to stop him. He literally did it by grabbing [VXU](VXU.md) and then dragging him away. [JHR](JHR.md), VXU and ToshyFEN is the only one to escape unscathed and uninjured. He just watched without doing anything until ToshyFEN intervened, shellshocked. DeltaCXG was probably saving him for last.
