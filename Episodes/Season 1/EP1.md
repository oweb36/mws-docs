This is the first [Episodes](Episodes/Episodes.md) of MWS. 


## Nutshell

Everyone is seen living their life, when suddenly JHR decides to propose a competition. He will be the one to host it. What do they do? Bet and stake things (JHR won't as he's the host, and he won't be a part of the bet).

## Plot
Its a day in the [Megarchive Warehouse](Megarchive%20Warehouse.md). Everyone is enjoying the day (foreshadowing).

We see the kitchen of the warehouse. Its empty, except that [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md) is there. He is eating bread after he fought [Piss](Piss.md). [AEX](AEX.md) then comes to the kitchen because JHR wants to smalltalk with AngelSaph. After the smalltalk is done, AngelSaph goes out of the living quarters to the outside.

We then get a shot back at the living quarters. Not many people are chilling, doing their everyday agendas:
- [Wheamy](Wheamy.md) is doing nothing and just day dreaming. 
- [WELLPan](WELLPan.md) is reading while [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md) is watching him do so because he has nothing better to do. 
- JHR of [AEX](AEX.md) is using the computer lab to browse the internet with his *TRS-80 Model 100* while the others watch him do so having no idea what he is doing. 
- [Xefa](Xefa.md) is fighting with [JVXH](JVXH.md) while [Xeo](Xeo.md) is also fighting with [RXe](RXe.md), and they are fighting over who is the best lesbian couple.
- [MHeLy](MHeLy.md) is just being herself (unknown acts, but said to be very kind). 
- [ZeNer](ZeNer.md) is doing stupid shit with high voltage mains electricity and electrical outlets (This will go so wrong). 
- [ToshyMEM](ToshyMEM.md), [ToshyRAVi](ToshyRAVi.md) and [ToshySMUT](ToshySMUT.md) are bitching with each other about an argument related to work and limits.
- [JKE](JKE.md) is leaking everyone's secret "accidentally" while [CKHSC](CKHSC.md) is trying to stop him from leaking very **SUSSY** because *its not nice to share people's secrets* (which is very true).
- [TERAS](TERAS.md) is setting up pranks for people with [Avxy](Avxy.md).
- [ZSRK](ZSRK.md) with his *sterotypical **evidence board*** solving problems.
- [Aufs](Aufs.md) hiding away in the corner somewhere. He is staring, stalking and watching people. Pretty creepy.

ZSRK then notices Aufs and responds "Aufs, what are you doing watching us like that in that corner? Its kinda creepy you know?" Everyone then sees ZSRK and Aufs. Wheamy then says "That's pretty creepy to stare down people. Are you stalking us to plot an assasination?" Aufs then claps back with "You saw nothing!" before dissapearing. Wheamy then says: "Aufs is weird, like why is he always in the dark?" ZeNer responds with that Aufs is always like that, but smth feels off about him.

[Wheamy](Wheamy.md) then goes outside to run some errands (AKA looking for parts) saying "Alright guys, I have to grab parts outside! See ya later!" and then we hear screaming from the outside. Wheamy (outside) is yelling: **"OH GA MAWD! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG)??? YOU CAN'T JUST KILL AND INJURE PEOPLE RANDOMLY OUT OF NOWHERE FOR NO REASON!!!"** 

Everyone from the living quarters goes outside and sees the carnage that DeltaCXG had done. We see its not a nice sight to behold. We see that [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md) was crushed to death by DeltaCXG with a crate. He's not the only victim though. DeltaCXG had also injured and killed many others.

DeltaCXG says to Wheamy: "Guess what? Some are dead and I will be adding more! What will you do about it?" Wheamy the continues: "Watch me recover them, you murderer!" and also says to [MXU](VXU.md#MXU): "Man, you need to step up your game! You are too slow to protect anybody from DeltaCXG, even with your power of mobility!" DeltaCXG, provoked from what Wheamy says, punches him. That's another victim of today that is added to DeltaCXG.

JHR then gives a sigh that has a "*here we go again*" vibes and drags Wheamy, injured back into the living quarters. Wheamy then uses the RSR of the living quarters to recover the murdered victims of DeltaCXG. Nothing he can do for the injured victims of DeltaCXG, including himself. So they have to deal with it. Wheamy then decides to rest and recover in the living quarters. But then DeltaCXG causes more carnage, thwarting Wheamy.


**TODO: MORE CARNAGE**

[ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md) finally had to step in and subdue DeltaCXG to stop him. He literally did it by grabbing [VXU](VXU.md) and then dragging him away. [AEX](AEX.md), [KaHLium](KaHLium.md), [WELLPan](WELLPan.md), [VXU](VXU.md), [CKHSC](CKHSC.md), [PKayFsa](PKayFsa.md), [ASTAC](ASTAC.md) and [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md) is the only one to escape unscathed and uninjured. He just watched without doing anything until ToshyFEN intervened, shellshocked. DeltaCXG was probably saving him for last. 

JHR then says to ToshyFEN: "Its great that you stopped DeltaCXG when we need him to stop. The aftermath, is not pretty. Almost everyone is either injured or dead. We need to sort this out." ToshyFEN then responds with: "Sure! Whatever you want to do to make this place **BETTER**!" JHR then responds back: "**JEEZ** you don't need to be that mani- *oh wait* you are not mentally well, alright ig you retarde-." ToshyFEN claps back with hostility "**WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT ME YOU ABLEI-???**" (while JHR was reevaluating his choice to call him the r slur).

WELLPan, who was busy reading then comes out and says "Hey guys! Anything new? I saw Wheamy coming back, but I just want to know what happened?" JHR then says "DeltaCXG just killed and injured, pretty much almost everyone here. Its a massacre outside. We are the only survivors who didn't get injured or killed in any way." WELLPan then says "Oh, many died because of this one person DeltaCXG?" ToshyFEN then calmly says "Yes."

WELLPan then comments: "Btw ZeNer died after messing with the electrical outlets." KaHLium then says: "Well, ig we know what not to play with. Fuck around and Find out is not a good idea. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes." JHR says "Yeah, someone better watch ZeNer next time. I fear that me might suddenly get his hands on a grenade and kill us all."
