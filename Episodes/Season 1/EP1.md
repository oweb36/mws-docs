This is the first [Episodes](Episodes/Episodes.md) of MWS. 


## Nutshell

Everyone is seen living their life, when suddenly JHR decides to propose a competition. He will be the one to host it. What do they do? Bet and stake things (JHR won't as he's the host, and he won't be a part of the bet).

## Plot
Its a day in the [Megarchive Warehouse](Megarchive%20Warehouse.md). Everyone is enjoying the day (foreshadowing).

We see the kitchen of the warehouse. Its empty, except that [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md) is there. He is eating bread after he fought [Piss](Piss.md). [JHR](JHR.md) then comes to the kitchen because he wants to smalltalk with AngelSaph. After the smalltalk is done, AngelSaph goes out of the living quarters to the outside.

We then get a shot back at the living quarters. Then we hear screaming from the outside. [Wheamy](Wheamy.md) (outside) is yelling: **"OH MA GAWD! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG)??? YOU CAN'T JUST KILL PEOPLE RANDOMLY OUT OF NOWHERE FOR NO REASON!!!"** DeltaCXG then says: "Well, I just did. [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md), [GiSY](GiSY.md) and [MHeLy](MHeLy.md) are dead. What will you do about it?" DeltaCXG had actually killed AngelSaph, GiSY, MHeLy.

Wheamy then angrily says: **"O RLY? Watch me recover them!"** Then everyone else comes out of the living quarters and sees the madness that had occurred, which is real nasty to their horror. We see the crime scene of DeltaCXG. DeltaCXG literally did *'crimes against humanity'* against his victims. We see that DeltaCXG had actually crushed AngelSaph and GiSY to death, while MHeLy is literally (uncleanly) cut in half. Blood and eether from AngelSaph's body and halo is everywhere.

Wheamy then angrily goes to the living quarters to recover DeltaCXG's victims. JHR then says to [MXU](VXU.md#MXU): "HOW DID YOU FAIL?" before MXU calmly responds with "Bro, he was too fast for me to react. By the time I saw what happened, he already killed AngelSaph, GiSY and MHeLy." 

[KaHLium](KaHLium.md) says: "How do you even respond calmly to this situation? Like how do you even do that?" MXU also responds to him with "I have seen [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) do this crap many times. My eyes are scarred, I am desensitized." [CTUX](VXU.md#CTUX) also joins with "Bro, I may do evil crap like underestimating others, but I am not that evil to kill."

[Piss](Piss.md) says "DeltaCXG, the next time I see you, you will regret it."
