## Personality

KaHLium is a level-headed person. He is not that insane, but not that chill. He is your average person. He just wants to be normal, that is it. Please don't make him that unique, he doesn't like that. KaHLium is also a serious person, who doesn't exactly tolerate no-nonsense things. This trait might conflict with others.

KaHLium has pretty dry humour. His humour is deadpan and anti-joke. He does not give emotions normally, especially with his humour. His humour is a representation of his personality. This is probably due to his birthday.

KaHLium being serious means that he is not the one to take jokes lightly. He is also a no-nonsense person, and does not exactly tolerate them well. He just wants to do things the way it is. Follow the instructions kind of person, down to earth kind of person, a realists. This may conflict with some of the nonsense-loving people of MWS.

KaHLium is also a fairly analytical and observant person. He observes his surroundings and checks on MHeLy often. KaHLium is also the kind of person to stalk others to gain intel. He potentially could know your browsing history and group chats.

KaHLium has one trait that most of the others don't in very pressuring situations: Common Sense. If you pit a fight against him in a turn-based combat system, he will dodge your attacks while the others won't.

KaHLium is a big brother to MHeLy. He loves her, and treats her well. They are literally part of the same family tree.

## Relations

MHeLy is KaHLium's younger sister. He loves her, and is protective of her. MHeLy motivates and makes KaHLium happy when he's down.

### [Fisios](Fisios.md)
They both are aware that they are down to basic, down to earth and practical. They talk like a normal conversation.

No funny things, but they are efficient when paired together. Due to them being down to basic and practical, they have an extremley high efficiency of work rate in doing work. They do the work and then immediately move on after doing everything needed for the work. No extra work, or incomplete work by them.

### [JHR](JHR.md)
JHR has a love-hate relationship with KaHLium, aka a frenemy situation. 

JHR likes him because he knows that KaHLium is smart. JHR also knows that KaHLium, despite being logical and very intelligent, is miles below JHR. JHR likes to teach KaHLium a lot of things. He gives him knowledge on life and general school knowledge.

JHR also knows that KaHLium is the elder brother to MHeLy. 

JHR dislikes one thing about KaHLium, his no-nonsense nature. He feels like he can't have fun with KaHLium. Why must he be miserable all the time?

Anyways, JHR tends towards the love side more than the hate side of his relationship with KaHLium. Basically JHR is more friends than enemies with KaHLium.

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)
KaHLium asks one question to WELLPan: Why.

He is so befuddled at WELLPan's chilness and lack of seriousness.
