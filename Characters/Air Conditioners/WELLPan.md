## Personality

WELLPan is one of the chillest and most easygoing person in the Megarchive Warehouse Show. He is pretty much the easygoing vibe carrier in AACOS. He has that unhinged, yet chill humor. WELLPan is also kinda lazy and unmotivated at times.

WELLPan is also very smart. He is a bookworm. He likes to read a lot. This shows that WELLPan is smart, but is too unmotivated to do things. He can lead and serve as a voice of guidance and leadership to motivate and guide others (his competitors/friends), but only if he is bothered to do so.

WELLPan may struggle with motivation and laziness, but don't underestimate him. He has the potential to win, but he doesn't want to. He is too chill. Everyone likes him because he is easy to get along with.

Just don't disturb him when he's reading or underestimate him, he doesn't like that.

## Relations

They are frenemies, but they are more of a friend that enemies. The only conflict that they can be in is in a friendly little competition of who can be the chillest, and WELLPan always wins. They just hang out with each other.
