WELLPan is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]]. He originally appeared in [[AACOS]].

## Identity

WELLPan is a Samsung AS09BPAN wall-mounted [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Well-Pan. His name is derived from the PAN of his species' model name and the *Well equidistributed long-period linear (WELL)* random number generator.

WELLPan was born in July 2007. He is a cisgender and helisexual male (he/him). Yes, he sexually identifies as an Apache Attack Helicopter. This is not a joke (kinda).  
If skin color matters, he is white.

He is one of the strongest person in the Megarchive Warehouse Show. He is also one of the most intelligent person in MWS. WELLPan is also one of the slowest person in MWS. WELLPan is one of the sanest person in MWS.

## Personality

WELLPan is one of the chillest and most easygoing person in the Megarchive Warehouse Show. He is pretty much the easygoing vibe carrier in AACOS. He has that unhinged, yet chill humor. WELLPan is also kinda lazy and unmotivated at times. To get his thin body to do something, you should motivate him.

WELLPan also doesn't really care about his surroundings that much, unless he is actually doing a **NOT SO LAZY** action like idk, **MOVING**? He is very oblivious, but thats only because like I said, he doesn't care about the surroundings. He is very care free. After all, he is lazy and chill to care about the chaos and his surroundings eh? This carefree personality and behavior of WELLPan is the reason why WELLPan is one of the sanest. He doens't care about the madness, and with that he doesn't let the chaos and insanity of the world bother him to insanity. He deals with his own problems and things.

WELLPan is also very smart. He is a bookworm. He likes to read a lot. This shows that WELLPan is smart, but is too unmotivated to do things. He can lead and serve as a voice of guidance and leadership to motivate and guide others (his competitors/friends), but only if he is bothered to do so.

WELLPan may struggle with motivation and laziness, but don't underestimate him. He has the potential to win, but he doesn't want to. He is too chill. Everyone, well almost everyone likes him because he is easy to get along with.

Just don't disturb him when he's reading or underestimate him, he doesn't like that. Nobody likes to be disturbed when reading books, in a library. Thats one of the few things that could actually piss him off.

## Relations

### [Aurl](Aurl.md)
They are frenemies, but they are more of a friend that enemies. The only conflict that they can be in is in a friendly little competition of who can be the chillest, and WELLPan always wins. They just hang out with each other.

## [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md)
They are typically duos. WELLPan is the chiller in this duo, while ToshyFEN is the more active one. WELLPan helps to cool ToshyFEN's unhinged side, and prevent little accidents involving mass murking of others.

In this duo, they could actually destroy the entire cast of MWS due to their sheer physical strength. WELLPan is not the one to start this, but he just tags along cus they are duos.

### [JHR](JHR.md)
They are good friends. JHR and WELLPan likes to read books in their spare time together.

### [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md)
They aren't close, but they are there. WELLPan and ToshyMEF are close due to few reasons. One of them is their weird sexuality where WELLPan identifies as an Apache Attack Helicopter and ToshyMEF identifies as an LG TV.

WELLPan knows the slight homophobia of ToshyMEF.

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)
To ToshyMEM, WELLPan is just dead weight. She may appreciate his presence, but he doesn't really do much.

### [ToshyMEM](ToshyMEM.md)
To ToshyMEM, WELLPan is just dead weight. She may appreciate his presence, but he doesn't really do much.

She asks one question: Why.

### [KaHLium](KaHLium.md)
KaHLium asks one question to WELLPan: Why.

He is so befuddled at WELLPan's chilness and lack of seriousness.
