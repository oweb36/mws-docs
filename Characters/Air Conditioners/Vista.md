Vista is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].

## Identity
Vista is a Daikin FFQ18Q2VJU 4-way-flow compact cassette [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). Vista's name is pronounced as Vista. Her name is derived from her series' name, which is Vista instead of her model.

Vista was born in July 7, 2018. She is asexual bigender (male/female bigender). Her pronouns are she/him, though she prefers she/her. We don't know why she prefers being called she/her, probably because of her name (idk though).

Vista has the Type-2 panel and BRC082A42S controller installed. 

If skin color matters, Vista is white.

Vista owns a *TRS-80 Model 100* portable computer. She is tech-savvy with it, and knows how to program it. She doesn't have much (along with others) but can afford a computer. [JHR](JHR.md) is the other people to own a *TRS-80 Model 100*.

## Personality
Vista is logically quite ok, but she is tech-savvy. Vista is a tech-savvy solver who always throws technology to solve problems, even when it is inappropriate. Vista is also very optimistic and realistic. Her ideas may clash with others who are more level-headed and have more common sense, and she is unapologetic for it. Vista is naturally and fully unapologetic ig, but ok. She is recklessly confident, so much that she dives head first even if the situation is not ripe, and she uses her skills to (try to) find a way.

Despite her being logically quite ok, she is also goofy and silly. This is in contrast to the other very [logi](KaHLium.md)[cal](Fisios.md)[ly](ToshyMEM.md) and "*common sensologically*" ok characters. She's not the most serious problem solver, which is another contrast. Vista would crack jokes, and her humor is not dry but wet. This means that she has a good sense of humor unlike those logically ok characters I mentioned. Her humor cacthes people off-guard, and it might even be offensive. Vista is also unapologetic about her humor, standing by it in full confidence even if it hurts others.

Vista being goofy means that she would also crack jokes at inappropriate moments. She always make a serious situation laughably comedic and funny.

Her optimistic stuborness with her logically ok and wet humor makes her a wildcard-ed sore thumb. She stands out with a uniqueness of her own: being that she is a logical person (kinda) with a great sense of humor and goofiness.
