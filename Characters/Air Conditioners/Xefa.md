Xefa is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].

## Identity

She's a Panasonic CS-XE12EKE wall-mounted [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). Her name is pronounced as Xe-fa.

She was born in 2006. She is a cisgender and lesbian female (she/her).  
If skin color mattered, she's white.

She wears dental braces because she's the valley girl. Not for *bri'ish* teeth, but for *valley girl* cosmetic reasons. Yes, valley girls wear braces because they are valley girls not nerd girls.

## Personality
She's the Valley Girl of the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). She speaks with an overly exaggerated Californian accent. Xefa also speaks like a Teenager, with the overuse of "like" everywhere like Valleyspeak or Valley Girl-aah linguistics.

She isn't smart, or even intelligent that much. If Xefa had hair and stereotype, she would also be the dumb blonde. Xefa is not a brainless beauty alright, she still has some intelligence, just not a lot.

## Relations

### [Xeo](Xeo.md)
They are couples eh. Not a very harmonic one, but they stick.

### [JVXH](JVXH.md)
JVXH fights with Xefa over who's the best lesbian couple.

JVXH points out that Xefa is a valley girl, while Xefa accueses JVXH  of being a school shooter. That's *ad hominem* and its not civil.
