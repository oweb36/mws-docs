Xefa is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].

## Identity

She's a Panasonic CS-XE12EKE wall-mounted [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). Her name is pronounced as Xe-fa.

She was born in 2006. She is a cisgender and lesbian female (she/her).  
If skin color mattered, she's white.

She wears dental braces because she's the valley girl. Not for *bri'ish* teeth, but for *valley girl* cosmetic reasons.

## Personality
She's the Valley Girl of the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). She speaks with an overly exaggerated Californian accent. Xefa also speaks like a Teenager, with the overuse of "like" everywhere like Valleyspeak or Valley Girl-aah linguistics.

She isn't smart, or even intelligent that much. If Xefa had hair and stereotype, she would also be the dumb blonde. 

## Relations

### [Xeo](Xeo.md)

They are couples eh. Not a very harmonic one, but they stick.
