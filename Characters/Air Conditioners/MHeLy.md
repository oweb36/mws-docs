## Personality

MHeLy is one of the nicer people in MVS. This is probably because she's a girl (More like woman. Wait, isn't that sexist? Probably, probably not. Nah).

MHeLy is a kind-hearted and empathetic to others. She is very creative with her work and competition, and even innovative. She is kind-hearted and willing to help others, even sacrificing herself at times. MHeLy is a pacifist, but she would still do violence if she has no choice.

MHeLy may also have self-doubt and be insecure at times, where she should withdraw and isolate herself from the others. She sometimes feels that with her principle of being nice and only attacking for defense, that she is used. But then she will bounce back!

MHeLy with her kindness, mostly forms good bonds and relationships with the others. She looks for friends too, but there are others who don't want to be friends with her. Some even declare themselves as enemies to MHeLy, but her kindness will pay off in the end.
