ToshyFEN is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]]. He originally appeared in [[AACOS]].

## Identity

ToshyFEN is a Toshiba floor-standing RAV-RM1601FT-EN [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Toh-she-Fen.

He was born in 2021, as a British person. He is a cisgender and heterosexual male.

He is one of the most durable person in MWS; He can survive injuries that would incapacitate or even kill others, and he can tolerate severe pain such as crotch kicks. ToshyFEN is also very heavy, in fact he is the heaviest out of them all.

If skin color matters, ToshyFEN is white.

ToshyFEN is the younger brother to [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md). They almost look similar except to their controller, where ToshyFEN has the newer "Lite-Vision plus" one.

ToshyFEN's Lite-Vision plus (RBC-AMSU51-EN) controller is his brain and his main method of being adjusted and controlled. ToshyFEN also has a TCB-AX32E2 wireless receiver kit installed, which is an auxilliary way to control him. ToshyFEN's Lite-Vision plus controller is his brain and is exposed to the world, so he is careful of it.

### Double Minded

ToshyFEN actually has two minds, and each of his minds has a face. ToshyFEN is still the same person though.

The main and dominant mind of ToshyFEN is at the front panel of his main body, while the auxilliary and recessive mind of ToshyFEN is in his controller. 

The dominant mind of ToshyFEN is named FEN while the recessive controller mind of ToshyFEN is named RBC. RBC is named that way because RBC is literaly a Toshiba RBC-AMSU51-EN controller. RBC also has control over ToshyFEN's TCB-AX32E2 wireless receiver. 

RBC is actually ToshyFEN's brain (because RBC is ToshyFEN's controller). If RBC is somehow gets damaged or killed, ToshyFEN would actually die. Yes, FEN would also die with RBC if RBC dies and vice versa. RBC is ToshyFEN's achilles' heel, and ToshyFEN would protect RBC. This is an irony because FEN is the dominant mind while RBC is the recessive and auxiliary mind despite RBC being ToshyFEN's brain. RBC is exposed to the outside world unlike [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md)'s controller that is hidden behind a protective cover. ToshyFEN's wireless receiver is not his brain unlike RBC.

FEN shows his face in the front panel physically, which means you can interact with his face. RBC shows his face in the lcd screen. RBC can't actually see well due to the quality of his lcd screen, but he still can see.

Both minds (FEN and RBC) prefers to be refered to as he/him because they both are the same person (ToshyFEN). They are not different a person, so don't refer to both of them as they/them, as you should refer to ToshyFEN as ToshyFEN if you want to refer to both minds.

## Personality

ToshyFEN is one person, but he has multiple minds. 

FEN is the volatile boi while RBC is the cautious one.

ToshyFEN is quite chill in general, but he can never be as chill as [WELLPan](WELLPan.md). ToshyFEN can also be insane and angrier than usual. FEN is the mind of ToshyFEN that is mentally unstable and insane, RBC is mentally stable and sane.
### FEN
FEN is the mentally unstable and insane mind of ToshyFEN. FEN is mentally not ok (insane and unstable). FEN basically has two personalities that are volatile at changing about. He is suffering from some kind of dissociative personality disorder.

 FEN has this one personality where he is really chill, and likes to chat. He can never be as chill as [WELLPan](WELLPan.md), but he is chill. He just listens, and talk a little. He likes small talk, and big talk. He is just there for WELLPan mostly, but can be there for others. Basically he just does nothing except listen and yap.

Then he has this other personality where he is straight up unhinged, crazy, insane, angry and violent. He commits harms to those who caused him this, and a bit of others. He isn't a sadist, but he is crazy. He literally chases others to no end with this. Yelling and screaming like a banshee as he runs. To no end he does this with no obvious goal at times. 

FEN would literally chase someone like a maniac, for eternity. He can be stopped and put back to his normal chill state by either calming him down, killing him, exhaust him or have his victim be killed.

FEN's volatile personality and mind can switch easily.

### RBC

RBC is the more cautious and chiller mind out of ToshyFEN. RBC is the mentally sane and stable mind out of ToshyFEN too.

RBC is pretty cautious about his surroundings. He is scared and untrusting normally of people. He fears what they can do to him and FEN. RBC just wants the best for ToshyFEN and his survival. RBC has this cautiousness because RBC knows that he is the brain and that if he dies, ToshyFEN dies.

RBC would warm up if he trusts someone. He is the chattier out of ToshyFEN normally. He small talks with people, but finds big talk (aka important talk) quite awkward and leaves it to FEN. RBC is also the one to try not to upset or be insenitive to others.

RBC is also the saner one, and he would try to stop FEN. RBC though doesn't have the power to control FEN because he is recessive, and wishes that one day he has just enough power to influence and control FEN.


## Relations

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)

They are typically duos. WELLPan is the chiller in this duo, while ToshyFEN is the more active one. ToshyFEN is the motivator to WELLPan to get him to do something.

In this duo, they could actually destroy the entire cast of MWS due to their sheer physical strength. ToshyFEN would likely be the one to start it, and he would drag WELLPan into this madness. ToshyFEN would also probably stick WELLPan to his back, and bring him along.

### [Aurl](Aurl.md)
Aurl respects ToshyFEN despite being older than him. Aurl knows about the strength of ToshyFEN, and how can his anger meltdowns go.

### [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md)
ToshyFEN loves ToshyMEF as a sibling. ToshyFEN and ToshyMEF know each other too well.

They are aware that they look very similar. Literally the only difference between them is that ToshyFEN's control panel is way newer than ToshyMEF's controller! ToshyMEF has the old Toshiba controller with icons, while ToshyFEN got that new "Lite-Vision plus" navigational and multilingual controller! Their main bodies even look the same. They like to prank others by impersonating each other.

ToshyFEN is wary of ToshyMEF's slight homophobia. He knows that ToshyMEF would go out to people of the LGBTQ+ community to say that LG TVs are better. He tries to restrain her from doing that rant.
