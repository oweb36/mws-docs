## Personality

He basically has two personalities that are volatile at changing about.

He has this one personality where he is really chill, and likes to chat. He can never be as chill as [WELLPan](WELLPan.md), but he is chill. He just listens, and talk a little. He likes small talk, and big talk. He is just there for WELLPan mostly, but can be there for others. Basically he just does nothing except listen and yap.

Then he has this other personality where he is straight up unhinged, crazy, insane, angry and violent. He commits harms to those who caused him this, and a bit of others. He isn't a sadist, but he is crazy. He literally chases others to no end with this. Yelling and screaming like a banshee as he runs. To no end he does this with no obvious goal at times.
