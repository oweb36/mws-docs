ToshyFEN is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]]. He originally appeared in [[AACOS]].

## Identity

ToshyFEN is a Toshiba floor-standing RAV-RM1601FT-EN [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Toh-she-Fen.

He was born in 2021, as a British person. He is a cisgender and heterosexual male.

He is one of the most durable person in MWS; He can survive injuries that would incapacitate or even kill others, and he can tolerate severe pain such as crotch kicks. ToshyFEN is also very heavy, in fact he is the heaviest out of them all.

ToshyFEN is kinda the most intelligent, but also not the most intelligent.

If skin color matters, ToshyFEN is white.

ToshyFEN is the younger brother to [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md). They almost look similar except to their controller, where ToshyFEN has the newer "Lite-Vision plus" one.

ToshyFEN's Lite-Vision plus (RBC-AMSU51-EN) controller is his brain and his main method of being adjusted and controlled. ToshyFEN also has a TCB-AX32E2 wireless receiver kit installed and attached to him, which is an auxiliary way to control him wirelessly. ToshyFEN's Lite-Vision plus controller is his brain and is exposed to the world, so he is careful of it.

### Double Minded

ToshyFEN actually has two minds, and each of his minds has a face. ToshyFEN is still the same person though.

The main and dominant mind of ToshyFEN is at the front panel of his main body, while the auxilliary and recessive mind of ToshyFEN is in his controller. 

The dominant mind of ToshyFEN is named FEN while the recessive controller mind of ToshyFEN is named RBC. RBC is named that way because RBC is literaly a Toshiba RBC-AMSU51-EN controller. RBC also has control over ToshyFEN's TCB-AX32E2 wireless receiver (RBC can talk and beep thru the TCB receiver, because normally RBC is mute without the TCB receiver). 

RBC is actually ToshyFEN's brain (because RBC is ToshyFEN's controller). If RBC is somehow gets damaged or killed, ToshyFEN would actually die. Yes, FEN would also die with RBC if RBC dies and vice versa. RBC is ToshyFEN's achilles' heel, and ToshyFEN would protect RBC. This is an irony because FEN is the dominant mind while RBC is the recessive and auxiliary mind despite RBC being ToshyFEN's brain. RBC is exposed to the outside world unlike [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md)'s controller that is hidden behind a protective cover. ToshyFEN's wireless receiver is not his brain unlike RBC, but it is the way RBC can talk and beep (and consequently the way ToshyFEN beeps).

FEN shows his face in the front panel physically, which means you can interact with his face. RBC shows his face in the lcd screen. RBC can't actually see well due to the quality of his lcd screen (resolution is quite crunchy like a dot matrix screen and has horrible color channels with him having 8-bit RGB coloring), but RBC is still capable of seeing (he ain't blind, neither is he colorblind).

Both minds (FEN and RBC) prefers to be refered to as he/him because they both are the same person (ToshyFEN). They are not different a person, so don't refer to both of them as they/them. ToshyFEN likes it when you use ToshyFEN to refer to both of his minds and use FEN or RBC when you want to refer to one of his individual minds.

## Personality

ToshyFEN is one person, but he has multiple minds. 

[FEN](#FEN) is the volatile boi while [FEN](#FEN) is the chill and cautious one.

ToshyFEN is quite chill in general, but he can never be as chill as [WELLPan](WELLPan.md). ToshyFEN can also be insane and angrier than usual. FEN is the mind of ToshyFEN that is mentally unstable and insane, RBC is mentally stable and sane.

In a nutshell for the above, FEN is not OK but he is the most capable one while RBC is OK but he is 'disabled' to say the least. With this, ToshyFEN in general has some of the worst mental health state.

RBC is also more intelligent than FEN. This is because RBC is the brain and is more observant. FEN has a below average intelligence. RBC is one of the most intelligent and smartest mind in the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md) along with [JHR](JHR.md), [WELLPan](WELLPan.md) and [MHeLy](MHeLy.md). RBC can't really use his intelligence to the full potential because the below-average-intelligence FEN is the dominant mind.

ToshyFEN can be caring and will step in to protect. He does this if the situation warrants it such as if nobody is willing to or he is literally the only one capable to do so.
### FEN
FEN is the mentally unstable and insane mind of ToshyFEN. FEN is mentally not ok (insane and unstable). FEN basically has two personalities that are volatile at changing about. 

He is suffering from:
- Dissociative Personality Disorder*
- *Intermittent Explosive Disorder*
- *Borderline Personality Disorder*
- *Disruptive Mood Regulation Disorder*. 

Yeah, FEN should be in a psychiatric hospital but he's here. FEN in fact has one of the worst mental health states in MWS.

 FEN has this one personality where he is really chill, and likes to chat. He can never be as chill as [WELLPan](WELLPan.md), but he is chill. He just listens, and talk a little. He likes small talk, and big talk. He is just there for WELLPan mostly, but can be there for others. Basically he just does nothing except listen and yap. FEN does observe people, but not that intently compared to [RBC](#RBC).

Despite FEN being observant, he is not that intelligent. In fact, FEN is below average intelligent.

Then he has this other personality where he is straight up unhinged, crazy, insane, angry and violent. He commits harms to those who caused him this, and a bit of others. He isn't a sadist, but he is crazy. He literally chases others to no end with this. Yelling and screaming like a banshee as he runs. To no end he does this with no obvious goal at times. 

FEN would literally chase someone like a maniac, for eternity. He can be stopped and put back to his normal chill state by either calming him down, killing him, exhaust him or have his victim be killed.

FEN is pretty unpredictable due to his mental health, being one of the worst in [MWS](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). You can't predict when he will get angery and be triggered. Heck! You don't even know what triggers him as most of his triggers keeps on changing.

FEN is caring sometimes when he is chill. He would step in to stop carnage if he has too in situations where nobody except himself is strong enough to do so. [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) is one such person who would create this kind of situations. If he is in his unhinged personality, this does not apply.

There's an exception though to that, RBC! FEN would do anything to protect RBC, as RBC is not only him, RBC is also his brain and also his "brother." FEN would even kill others just to protect RBC. FEN, even in his unhinged personality would still protect RBC.

FEN's volatile personality and mind can switch easily. He is caring though to some, especially [RBC](#RBC).

### RBC

RBC is the more cautious and chiller mind out of ToshyFEN. RBC is the mentally sane and stable mind out of ToshyFEN too.

RBC is pretty cautious about his surroundings. He is scared and untrusting normally of people. He fears what they can do to him and FEN. RBC just wants the best for ToshyFEN and his survival. RBC has this cautiousness because RBC knows that he is the brain and that if he dies, ToshyFEN dies.

RBC would warm up if he trusts someone. He is the chattier out of ToshyFEN normally. He small talks with people, but finds big talk (aka important talk) quite awkward and leaves it to FEN. RBC is also the one to try not to upset or be insenitive to others. 

RBC is very observant, even more observant than [FEN](#FEN). RBC observes things intently on the background while FEN is on the front scenes. This allows RBC to gather intel discretely and covertly when FEN is doing other things. RBC can use this to cook up some mighty blackmail or sabotage plans. RBC is also very intelligent due to him learning thru observation.

RBC is also the saner one, and he would try to stop FEN. RBC though doesn't have the power to control FEN because he is recessive, and wishes that one day he has just enough power to influence and control FEN. The only thing RBC can do is talk to FEN silently and influence his thoughts, but he has no power over the movement of ToshyFEN.

RBC cares for FEN and wishes he could help influence him for good, but he doesn't have enough power to do so. RBC knows that FEN really cares for him.


## Relations

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)

They are typically duos. WELLPan is the chiller in this duo, while ToshyFEN is the more active one. ToshyFEN is the motivator to WELLPan to get him to do something. WELLPan is aware of ToshyFEN's very bad mental health state, and he does whatever he can to keep it under control.

In this duo, they could actually destroy the entire cast of MWS due to their sheer physical strength. ToshyFEN would likely be the one to start it, and he would drag WELLPan into this madness. ToshyFEN would also probably stick WELLPan to his back, and bring him along.

ToshyFEN's meltdown might cause WELLPan to freak out if there's nobody to stop him.

### [Aurl](Aurl.md)
Aurl respects ToshyFEN despite being older than him. Aurl knows about the strength of ToshyFEN, and how can his anger meltdowns go. Aurl kinda fears but is concerned about ToshyFEN's very bad mental health state.

### [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md)
ToshyFEN loves ToshyMEF as a sibling. ToshyFEN and ToshyMEF know each other too well. Both ToshyFEN and ToshyMEF are some of the strongest people in [MWS](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md), after [WELLPan](WELLPan.md).

They are aware that they look very similar. Literally the only difference between them is that ToshyFEN's control panel is way newer than ToshyMEF's controller! ToshyMEF has the old Toshiba controller with icons, while ToshyFEN got that new "Lite-Vision plus" navigational and multilingual controller! Their main bodies even look the same. They like to prank others by impersonating each other.

ToshyFEN is wary of ToshyMEF's slight homophobia. He knows that ToshyMEF would go out to people of the LGBTQ+ community to say that LG TVs are better. He tries to restrain her from doing that rant.

ToshyMEF on the contrary is aware of ToshyFEN's quite horrible mental health. She is ready to subdue him when the situation is right. She has enough strength to do that. Sometimes ToshyMEF thinks whether ToshyFEN should go to a psychatric hospital.

### [RXe](RXe.md)
RXe finds ToshyFEN too unpredictable to manipulate. She doesn't know if what she does would trigger him. She doesn't even bother to manipulate ToshyFEN for her own because she doesn't know what would ToshyFEN do next.

ToshyFEN is the kind of person to stop RXe when she gets too far. ToshyFEN also in fact will and have stopped her multiple times.

ToshyFEN is scary to RXe eventhough RXe is the evil one. RXe is quite scared of ToshyFEN because ToshyFEN is quite unhinged at times and would kill. RXe questions whether he should be in a mental hospital, and sometimes doesn't know what to do with him.

### [Wheamy](Wheamy.md)
Wheamy doesn't know what to do with ToshyFEN. He has a dillema: help him or hate him. He doesn't know whether he should help and protect ToshyFEN or hate and try to avoid him.

Wheamy feels this way because he knows that ToshyFEN is still young, and in fact younger than him. Wheamy also knows that ToshyFEN needs some help because he is aware of his poor mental health. The other side is that Wheamy knows that ToshyFEN can be unhinged and angry. ToshyFEN might even make his life harder than what he has know.

Wheamy is very confused and worried about ToshyFEN. ToshyFEN to him is a mentally unstable person who needs help. This is because ToshyFEN fits both for Wheamy's need to help him and him making Wheamy's work harder.

### [VXU](VXU.md)
VXU has two sides: Fear and concern.

[MXU](VXU.md#MXU) is quite concerned and fearful about ToshyFEN. MXU is concerned about his mental wellbeing, as you know ToshyFEN has some of the worst mental health states in MWS. He is also feareful because he knows that ToshyFEN can do some unhinged shit.

[CTUX](VXU.md#CTUX) has less concern and less fear compared to MXU, but he still has those feelings. He is less concerned because he feels that he can take on him if needed, but he won't for the most part.

[DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) has no concern, but more fear. DeltaCXG has no concern about his mental health, and why would he? DeltaCXG is this sociopath who doesn't care about others. He is willing to bully them for fun.  
DeltaCXG is also fearful of ToshyFEN because his mental health is not good and he can do unhinged shit again. DeltaCXG fears what ToshyFEN is capable of. Even with that, DeltaCXG would still try to bully this guy. DeltaCXG knows that ToshyFEN is one of the few people capable of stopping him.

So, MXU and CTUX are concerned and rather not get in trouble with ToshyFEN. DeltaCXg on the other hand, though knows the danger of ToshyFEN would still try to make some trouble with him.
