ToshyFEN is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]]. He originally appeared in [[AACOS]].

## Identity

ToshyFEN is a Toshiba floor-standing RAV-RM561FT-EN [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Toh-she-Fen.

He was born in 2021, as a British person. He is a cisgender and heterosexual male.

He actually has two minds, and each of his minds has a face. The main mind of ToshyFEN is at the front panel of his main body, while the auxilliary mind of ToshyFEN is in his controller.

He is one of the most durable person in MWS; He can survive injuries that would incapacitate or even kill others, and he can tolerate severe pain such as crotch kicks. ToshyFEN is also very heavy, in fact he is the heaviest out of them all.

If skin color matters, ToshyFEN is white.

ToshyFEN is the younger brother to [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md). They almost look similar except to their controller, where ToshyFEN has the newer one.

## Personality

He basically has two personalities that are volatile at changing about.

He has this one personality where he is really chill, and likes to chat. He can never be as chill as [WELLPan](WELLPan.md), but he is chill. He just listens, and talk a little. He likes small talk, and big talk. He is just there for WELLPan mostly, but can be there for others. Basically he just does nothing except listen and yap.

Then he has this other personality where he is straight up unhinged, crazy, insane, angry and violent. He commits harms to those who caused him this, and a bit of others. He isn't a sadist, but he is crazy. He literally chases others to no end with this. Yelling and screaming like a banshee as he runs. To no end he does this with no obvious goal at times. ToshyFEN would literally chase someone like a maniac, for eternity. He can be stopped and put back to his normal chill state by either calming him down, killing him, exhaust him or have his victim be killed.

## Relations

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)

They are typically duos. WELLPan is the chiller in this duo, while ToshyFEN is the more active one. ToshyFEN is the motivator to WELLPan to get him to do something.

In this duo, they could actually destroy the entire cast of MWS due to their sheer physical strength. ToshyFEN would likely be the one to start it, and he would drag WELLPan into this madness. ToshyFEN would also probably stick WELLPan to his back, and bring him along.

### [Aurl](Aurl.md)
Aurl respects ToshyFEN despite being older than him. Aurl knows about the strength of ToshyFEN, and how can his anger meltdowns go.

### [ToshyMEF](ToshyMEF.md)
ToshyFEN loves ToshyMEF as a sibling. ToshyFEN and ToshyMEF know each other too well.

They are aware that they look very similar. Literally the only difference between them is that ToshyFEN's control panel is way newer than ToshyMEF's controller! ToshyMEF has the old Toshiba controller with icons, while ToshyFEN got that new navigational and multilingual controller! Their main bodies even look the same. They like to prank others by impersonating each other.

ToshyFEN is wary of ToshyMEF's slight homophobia. He knows that ToshyMEF would go out to people of the LGBTQ+ community to say that LG TVs are better. He tries to restrain her from doing that rant.
