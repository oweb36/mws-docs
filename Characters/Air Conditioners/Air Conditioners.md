These [character](Characters) are a class of species in the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]]. 

The Air Conditioners encompasses Air Conditioners, Heat Pumps and their accessories such as their controllers. Well, the last in the bunch of those objects are technically incorrect, but eh. So Air Conditioners are just megaclasses.

The air conditioners and heat pumps can have multiple body types. Here are the available body types:

- Wall-mounted
- Cassette
	- 1-way
	- 2-way
	- 4-way
	- 360
- Floor Standing
- Window
- Floor Console

And then there are the controllers, which are usually companions to the main unit. The controllers may be independent though.

They are inorganic and electronic in nature, so their logic board is like their brain. Any damage to their body parts would impair its ability and function.
