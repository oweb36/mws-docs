Xeo is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].

## Identity

She's a Panasonic CS-XE21MKEW wall-mounted [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). Xeo is a superior version of [JKE](JKE.md). Her name is pronounced as Xeo (AKA Seyo). Don't call her shio or sio (AKA see-yo), she would attack you for that.

She was born in August 10, 2010. She is a cisgender and bisexual female (she/her).  
If skin color mattered, she's silver.

## Personality
TLDR: Angry-ass. Bitchy-ass catty girl. Quite hostile, especially to women/girls. Gives you ***EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!*** Known to physically assault others, in the most girlish way we men call as **Catfighting**. Usually falls like a **sad** if someone does decides to strike back. Almost never in a good mood. Anger may subside, but **NEVER** fully. My be good, but **NOT** that as she is still an asshole Yes, has a golden heart, but shadowed by anger and eternal rage. Known to use harm and laceration as a love language, since thats all she knows to show love. Yeah, she has social skill issues lol.


She's the angry-ass catty one.

Yeah, she is also smart enough. May not be *academia* smart, but is **street** smart.

You might say: "She's actually an evil person, she does this for fun!" **N O P E**! There's a valid reason for her pretty rude and aggressive behavior.

While other characters like [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md) and [Aurl](Aurl.md) has their chill moments. She ain't [WELLPan](WELLPan.md) bruh.

Despite that, she can be good. Not nice, not kind, just good in some mysterious way. So yeah, we got an extremely angry good girl here eh this lesbian bitch-ass ~~faggot~~-slag. And yes, she has some goodness, but shadowed by the anger.

She is known to be good with her girlfriend(s), but still quite a wrathful ragin' bitch-ass woman/girl she is.

## Relations

### [Xefa](Xefa.md)
They are couples eh. Not a very harmonic one, but they stick.

### [JKE](JKE.md)
Xeo sees JKE as an inferior version of herself. She does not like him. She would talk shit about him, being inferior.

Crap talks of Xeo: "You ain't deluxe," "Why so small?"

You get it.

### [NAEphthalene (NEptha)](NAEphthalene.md)
NEptha dislikes Xeo. Its because Xeo is a woman, and just catty.

### [RXe](RXe.md)
RXe and Xeo rather not fight, even though RXe is evil. RXe thinks that Xeo is not even worthy to fight, but is forced.

Who forces them? [Xefa](Xefa.md) and [JVXH](JVXH.md).
