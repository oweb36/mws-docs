Xeo is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].

## Identity

She's a Panasonic CS-XE21MKEW wall-mounted [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). Xeo is a superior version of [JKE](JKE.md). Her name is pronounced as Xeo (AKA Seyo). Don't call her shio or sio (AKA see-yo), she would attack you for that.

She was born in August 10, 2010. She is a cisgender and bisexual female (she/her).  
If skin color mattered, she's silver.

## Personality

She's the catty one.

Xeo is pretty catty, bitchy and passive aggressive. Very catty to say the least. She's very hostile to others, especially other female people or women. She hates other girls basically. Xeo may insult others, pretty brutally. The way she insults can give others, even the hardened ones ***EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!*** So don't cross her path or go near her when Xeo is in the process of brutally murdering someone psychologically and emotionally.

Xeo would also sometimes physically assault others. Its not that severe, its your typical **WOMAN** fight, the pretty frail **WOMAN** fight. Catfight, yeah! Flail hands, yeah! That's how she fights. Others would either ignore her, or if they are really annoyed they would give her a (sometimes brutal) beatdown and causing her to (sometimes pretty badly) get hurt. Xeo wouldn't fight back, because she's also a Coward.

You might say: "She's actually an evil person, she does this for fun!" **N O P E**! There's a valid reason for her pretty rude and aggressive behavior.

Xeo is always angry. She's never in a good mood, never with others. Her anger might subside, but shall never completely be gone and away. Xeo will be that one angry person in [MWS](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). While other characters like [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md) and [Aurl](Aurl.md) has their chill moments, Xeo has none of those. She is never chill, but will always be angery. Even the moments where her anger subsides is considered as unicorn. Its rare!

And yes, Xeo has unresolved anger issues. It has gone on for so long that its probably unresolvable. She's not a good person to be with, due to how she's always angry.

## Relations

### [Xefa](Xefa.md)

They are couples eh. Not a very harmonic one, but they stick.

### [JKE](JKE.md)
Xeo sees JKE as an inferior version of herself. She does not like him. She would talk shit about him, being inferior.

Crap talks of Xeo: "You ain't deluxe," "Why so small?"

You get it.

### [NEptha](NEptha.md)
NEptha dislikes Xeo. Its because Xeo is a woman, and just catty.
