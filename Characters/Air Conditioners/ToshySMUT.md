## Personality

He is rude and smutty, but not bad. He just doesn't know how to express himself nicely. He is just a poor misunderstood soul, who is trying to be nice but people take him as a rude person.

ToshySMUT appears as rude as he would interrupt people randomly, and say not so nice stuff about others. He would sometimes drop bombshell truths about others when its not appropriate. This is why people see him as a smut.

ToshySMUT is a good person though. Its just that he doesn't know how to express himself nicely, and in fact he also doesn't know how to properly socialize. He is too isolated for it. If he is not rude, he can tell you stories from his heart and his struggles.
