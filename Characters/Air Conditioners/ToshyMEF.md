ToshyMEF is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].
## Identity
She is a Toshiba MMF-AP0151H floor standing [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). Her name is pronounced as Toh-She-Mef.

She was born in April 6, 2005. She is a TV-sexual cisgendered-female (she/her). She is TV-sexual because she's attracted to LG TVs, as she finds LG TVs better than LGBTQ. Well, at least LG TVs can handle 4k and many colors, unlike LGBTQ with its 6-colored flag (why am I doing this).

If skin color mattered, ToshyMEF is white.

ToshyMEF is the older sister to [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md). They almost look similar except to their controller, where ToshyFEN has the newer one.

ToshyMEF is quite durable, but not as durable as compared to [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md).

## Personality
ToshyMEF is sassy. She has that rudeness. She is not subtle about some things. She is not that angry, but is not chill. She speaks like a Californian, but not Valleyspeak. Very american-aah girl accent, and speech patterns. She also got the Alpha Bitch and Manipulative Bastard in her. She is rude, but is even more rude to those she dislikes. She also lightly manipulates people thru emotions.

One thing unique about her is that ToshyMEF is that she's slightly homophobic. ToshyMEF is this way because she believes that LG TVs is better than LGBTQ+. This homophobia is not severe like wishing someone to die, but she targets the LGBTQ+ people more than the rest, to flex LG TVs. We all know [why](#Identity) do we?

So, she's a sassy-aah rude californian slight homophobe.

## Relations

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)
They aren't close, but they are there. WELLPan and ToshyMEF are close due to few reasons. One of them is their weird sexuality where WELLPan identifies as an Apache Attack Helicopter and ToshyMEF identifies as an LG TV.

WELLPan knows the slight homophobia of ToshyMEF.

### [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md)
ToshyFEN loves ToshyMEF as a sibling. ToshyFEN and ToshyMEF know each other too well.

They are aware that they look very similar. Literally the only difference between them is that ToshyFEN's control panel is way newer than ToshyMEF's controller! ToshyMEF has the old Toshiba controller with icons, while ToshyFEN got that new navigational and multilingual controller! Their main bodies even look the same. They like to prank others by impersonating each other.

ToshyFEN is wary of ToshyMEF's slight homophobia. He knows that ToshyMEF would go out to people of the LGBTQ+ community to say that LG TVs are better. He tries to restrain her from doing that rant.
