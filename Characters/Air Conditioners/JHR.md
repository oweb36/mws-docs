## Personality

In a nutshell, he behaves differently in different situations. JHR is still a good guy though.
### As a host
JHR is warm and welcoming, albeit strict at times. He is also a workaholic, so he would probably get depressed if he doesn't do anything. He is the host after all, what do you expect? He wants and needs to do his job.

### As a normal person
As a normal person, he is a good person to hang out with, but can be weird and sociopathic at times. He is not exactly normal in his mind, so he may speak random garbage that you weren't supposed to hear.

JHR is fairly chatty relatively, but he is not as chatty as [JKE](JKE.md). He likes to talk about knowledge. He likes to exchange life with you and him. JHR is practically pretty much down to basic in his chattiness, he just wants to make people comfortable. JHR may also spew out garbage, very random garbage once in a while. Its typically indiscernible noises, or just his thoughts.

JHR is also the kind of person to teach you how to do things. If you don't know how to read, or fail miserably at walking, JHR will show you how. He enjoys teaching and tutoring others.

### Sociopathy
In his sociopathy, he is sadistic (not murderous). He likes pain, but isn't that all? Anyways. He is also good to hang out as he can rant and chat with you about many things.

JHR also knows that KaHLium is the elder brother to MHeLy. 

JHR dislikes one thing about KaHLium, his no-nonsense nature. He feels like he can't have fun with KaHLium. Why must he be miserable all the time?

Anyways, JHR tends towards the love side more than the hate side of his relationship with KaHLium. Basically JHR is more friends than enemies with KaHLium.

With the difference in the generations, JHR and CKHSC knows the progression of life.
