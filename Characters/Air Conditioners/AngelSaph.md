AngelSaph is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].

## Identity

He is a Gree Sapphire SAP18HP230V1AH wall-mounted [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Angel-Saph.

He was born on September 13, 2022. He is a demifluid male (he/they).

AngelSaph also has a floating shiny white-golden halo that surrounds him. Its composed of an alloy made of Gold, Titanium, Platinum and Aluminium. AngelSaph's halo can act as a protection for any attacks against him due to its composition. If his halo gets damaged (cracked, shattered, broken), it can regenerate slowly over time. He can still feel (reduced) pain if the halo gets damaged by impact as its part of him. He is kinda like an angel, but he isn't actually one.

He has flesh unlike others, so he is technically a Cyborg and needs to eat and drink to survive. He doesn't need to excrete waste or breath though.
