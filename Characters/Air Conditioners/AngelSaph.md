## Identity

He is a Gree Sapphire SAP18HP230V1AH wall-mounted [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Angel-Saph.

He was born on September 13, 2022. He is a demifluid male (he/they).

AngelSaph also has a halo. Its detailed in the section titled [Halo](#Halo). He is a partial Angel.

He has flesh unlike others, so he is technically a Cyborg and needs to eat and drink to survive. He doesn't need to excrete waste or breath though.

AngelSaph's halo is a floating shiny white-golden halo that surrounds him. Its tilted up to the right and it can glow in the dark.

Its composed of an alloy made of Gold, Titanium, Platinum and Aluminium. It slowly spins clockwise.

If he is emotionally hurt, in trauma, in a bad state of mental health or experiencing emotional pain, then his regeneration of the halo will slow down.

The Halo is an intergral part of AngelSaph's body. He can still feel (slightly dulled) pain if the halo is damaged or impacted hardly. Any part of the halo that is broken can create a very slight and subtle feelings of aching. He can also feel tactile stimuli such as touch on the halo. Pulling on the halo can give him a dull headache. So please don't tug or drag AngelSaph by the halo.
