AngelSaph is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].

## Identity

He is a Gree Sapphire SAP18HP230V1AH wall-mounted [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Angel-Saph.

He was born on September 13, 2022. He is a demifluid male (he/they). This means that he is half male and half genderfluid. Normally his genderfluid side is female, making him bigender, but he can change his genderfluid side into any other if the circustance and situation warrants it.

AngelSaph also has a halo. Its detailed in the section titled [Halo](#Halo). He is a partial Angel.

He has flesh unlike others, so he is technically a Cyborg and needs to eat and drink to survive. He doesn't need to excrete waste or breath though. His organic flesh supplements and enchances his inorganic electronics, not the other way around.

### Halo
AngelSaph's halo is a floating shiny white-golden halo that surrounds him. Its tilted up to the right of AngelSaph and it can glow in the dark a yellow shine. Its an intergral part of his body; You can't just detach and knock AngelSaph's halo of him, but you can push the halo as its not rigidly fixed to him.

Its composed of an alloy made of Gold, Titanium, Platinum, Aluminium, Phosphor and Fluorine. This halo is hard and glows in the dark as a result of it. It slowly spins clockwise, though if he is in a bad mental health state, it will slow down and in cases where his mental health is extremely bad, it will slowly spin counter-clockwise.

AngelSaph's halo can act as a protection for any attacks against him due to its composition. If his halo gets damaged (cracked, shattered, broken), it can regenerate slowly over time. If he is emotionally hurt, in trauma, in a bad state of mental health or experiencing emotional pain, then his regeneration of the halo will slow down. If he is emotionally hurt enough, the regeneration of his halo may stop.

The Halo being an intergral part of AngelSaph's body can give him tactile sensation. He can still feel (slightly dulled) pain if the halo is damaged or impacted hardly. Any part of the halo that is broken can create a very slight and subtle feelings of aching. If fact, if the halo is severely damaged to the point like only a single bit is intact, the pain would be so severe that AngelSaph could pass out. If his halo is so damaged that there is no remaining intact halo, he would feel a headache until at least a small part of his halo regenerates.  
He can also feel tactile stimuli such as touch on the halo. Pulling on the halo can give him a dull headache.  So please don't tug or drag AngelSaph by the halo cus he can feel it, and its not good for him and rude for you to do.

Whenever AngelSaph's halo is damaged, any parts that were broken off will no longer float with him and instead falls down. The remaining intact halo still floats, and spins in place as if it were a complete halo. The remaining intact halo also begins to slowly bleed an unknown golden liquid that is neither is blood or hot with the viscosity of tears.

## Personality
He is a gentle and depressed angel in a nutshell. 

AngelSaph is emotionally sensitive, and empathetic to other's feelings and pain. He cares a lot about others. He is there for others and their pain. He will do whatever he can to make them feel better about themselves, others and in life.

He is stoic and calm. He is pretty much emotionally stable and will not do anything crazy. He may be slow, but he does anything. Nothing can beat the chillness and calmness of [WELLPan](WELLPan.md).

He is quite vulnerably emotionally and physically though. AngelSaph would also try to avoid any physical contact in fear of his halo getting damaged. He can get emotionally hurt easily, with harsh and rude words, along with rude actions and name calling. 

AngelSaph is also fairly reserved. He is quite distant and isolated from the others. He is not fairly chatty, and is much of an introvert. AngelSaph wouldn't interfere in a conflict and let it play out unless he has to. If a conflict is going on, he may feel hurt but will not do anything about it unless he has to such as the conflict exploding in scope and heating up. One thing where he would risk his halo and interfere in a conflict if it becomes physically violent.

AngelSaph is also slightly depressed on the inside due to his nature and sensitivity. He is a fairly sensitive fellow, being able to be easily hurt emotionally. His nature of being a partial angel does not help, as he has a feeling that he may not be able to fulfill his role as an Angel of protection for others, and he doubts it sometimes. He feels a slight sadness in himself, which might subtly manifest in him withdrawing silently, or being distant to others. He does not make his sadness obvious to others though. AngelSaph is very good at hiding this inner depression and sadness, and will only reveal this sadness to those he can trust.
