AngelSaph is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].

## Identity

He is a Gree Sapphire SAP18HP230V1AH wall-mounted [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md). His name is pronounced as Angel-Saph.

He was born on September 13, 2022. He is a demifluid male (he/they).

AngelSaph also has a halo. Its detailed in the section titled [Halo](#Halo). He is a partial Angel.

He has flesh unlike others, so he is technically a Cyborg and needs to eat and drink to survive. He doesn't need to excrete waste or breath though.

### Halo
AngelSaph's halo is a floating shiny white-golden halo that surrounds him.

Its composed of an alloy made of Gold, Titanium, Platinum and Aluminium. It slowly spins clockwise.

AngelSaph's halo can act as a protection for any attacks against him due to its composition. If his halo gets damaged (cracked, shattered, broken), it can regenerate slowly over time. He can still feel (reduced) pain if the halo gets damaged by impact as the halo is part of his body. You can literally drag him by the halo, but that's rude to do so.

Whenever AngelSaph's halo is damaged, any parts that were broken off will no longer float with him and instead falls down. The remaining intact halo still floats, and spins as if it were complete. The remaining intact halo also begins to slowly bleed an unknown golden liquid.
