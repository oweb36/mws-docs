Aufs is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].

## Identity

Aufs is a Fujitsu [AUG45AGB3W](fujitsu-gemstone-amber-ironoxide-cassette_mcgrp.ru-wUHQLxwD.pdf)  [air conditioner](Air%20Conditioners.md). His name has several pronunciations which he can accept, which includes:
- A-U-F-S, or Ay-You-Eff-Ess.
- Aufs, or Offs (Disliked)
- Au-F-S, or O-F-S (Preferred)

The reason why his name is so divergent from his model is because during the development of Aufs, his species as the Fujitsu **AUG54FUAS** (Still a cassette heat pump). He was changed because there was more documentation with the Fujitsu AUY45AGB3W compared to the Fujitsu AUG54FUAS. His name Aufs was derived from the "AU" and the "FUAS" of the Fujitsu AUG54FUAS (Excuse to use the awesome filesystem name of aufs), and its kept here because it just is too good of a name to waste. The species of AUG54FUAS and the AUY45AGB3W is technically the same, except being a different generation and that the AGB3W is a cooling-only model, so they should be similar other than those facts.

He was born in September 9, 2003. They are Bigender, its a very [complicated topic](#Gender%20Identity). His pronouns are (he/them).

He is white if skin color matters. He has yellowed quite a bit from age, but he is still white. Aufs can be retrobrighted, but he rather stay in this yellowed state.

Aufs is more durable than the average person in the [Megarchive Warehouse](Megarchive%20Warehouse.md). He can survive way more injuries and potentially even injuries that are lethal to a normal person in the [Megarchive Warehouse](Megarchive%20Warehouse.md), but he can't beat [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md). Aufs is also the sanest person in MWS, he would probably one of the only few to sane if everyone goes insane. 

Aufs can break the 4th wall. He can see the 4th wall and the camera. He knows about the audience, but keeps silent about it (mostly).

Aufs is also kinda the butt monkey of the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

### Being the Butt Monkey

Aufs is kinda the butt monkey of MWS. Its a semi-official status. He is also the iron butt monkey of MWS. He is the punching bag of MWS, the guy of comedic sadism.

This means that one character that always get put thru hell. He goes thru a lot of pain lol. Like he would fail trying to mount to his bed in the [living quarters beds](Megarchive%20Warehouse.md#Beds) and then fall off to the ground (painfully).

He gets thru a lot of pain, emotionally and physically. He sometimes is made fun off, despite him not liking it and trying to put up a tuff guy facade. Like he is the one to get physically abused a lot, painfully and brutal at times. Like he somehow gets crushed or actually gets attacked by others. He can survive this because he is way more durable than the average person of MWS and that he is also the iron butt monkey.

Emotional pain, he is made fun of many times. He gets pranked a lot, and this is why.

### Gender Identity
Aufs's gender is Bigender. Its pretty complicated, because Aufs is well, is half gender fluid and half agender. This means he technically is demiagender and demigenderfluid if we see the half of the sides (because demi means half here, let me redefine that for my ease). His pronouns are he/them.

He has an agender side, which means he is half agender. This agender side is unique. His agender side is not binary, and not even non-binary. His agender side is not even genderfluid. His agender side is well, Aufs. Aufs partly identifies as Aufs. This unique agenderness is why Aufs sees himself as demiagender or half agender, because he is Aufs and not some gender in one half of his bigender identity. This Aufs gender identity is why he identifies as *them*. Aufs is his agender side.

His genderfluid side, or his demifluid (gender fluid half) side is well non-binary. His genderfluid half of his bigender identity is non-binary. The reason why he is half non-binary is because he doesn't know if he wants to be male or female, or any other gender. Its easy to be non-binary. This non-binary side is in fact, why his pronouns has "*them*."

So as you can see, he is Aufs and non-binary bigender practically. And bigender being transgender, means that Aufs is transgender. He kinda agrees with this, because well he is not male (though if biology is him, he would be sexed as male). In reality he is Aufs and genderfluid bigender. So he is indeed both Aufs and non-binary.

With his sexual orientation, its easy. Aufs is toric, which means he likes males, or **MAN**. This is why he also has *he* as his pronouns.

Thats a lot to yap, and it probably uses incorrect terms. And yes its a lot to yap, cus his identity is complicated.

## Personality
Aufs is Aufs. He is simply Aufs. He is proud of being Aufs as his identity. This is why he is probably the sanest. Him being Aufs will make him remember that he is still Aufs and not some maniac in the event that everyone goes insane, and this identity and memory keeps Aufs sane as Aufs remembers that he is still Aufs.

Aufs is also mysterious. Not many people know a lot about him, as he is quite secretive and secluded. He is not the most social person in the [Megarchive Warehouse](Megarchive%20Warehouse.md). He doesn't interact a lot with people. He always seems to be plotting something.

He though is an egotistical perfectionist. He is pretty cunning and sly, very furtive. He would reveal this side randomly in the event that he decides to reveal himself. He flexes on people and shows how **PROUD** he is to be Aufs and sane.

Aufs puts this egotistical tough guy facade, but he is a softie in reality. If you know him well, he is actually a great person to talk too. But don't share his secrets, or you will break his trust. He may help you, but not really that much. He may be creepy, but he is not the kind of guy who would go to a women's bathroom.

Aufs is always plotting something. It is usually mundane or ridiculous (but sometimes, rarely it might be an assassination or a genocide plot), but the way he does so is creepy and gives off an evil vibe. This is amplified with his mysterious nature. People don't really trust and fear him because he is mysterious and always seems to be doing something in the background, and they don't know about what he is doing.

Aufs is also the kind of person to point out retcons and plot holes. He is that one nerd that goes *"Umm, actually..."* Aufs would also break the 4th wall. Mostly nobody understands him, but sometimes they can see what is he talking about. He knows way too much. He looks weird mostly when he is doing so and nobody can see what he is talking about. They just see a creepy guy being delusional. Sometimes though, they might be surprised when they see what Aufs is doing and when they can actually do the same thing Aufs did such as seeing the retcons and actually breaking the 4th wall.

Aufs is also funny when made fun of. He is quite a funny person after all, even though he ain't aims to be that. This is why he kinda the [butt monkey](#Being%20the%20Butt%20Monkey) of the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

## Relations

### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)
They are friends, because they are *SANE* unlike [some](ToshyFEN.md) other people or friends.

WELLPan might question Aufs at times about his behavior of lurking in the dark. He feels something is off when that happens, but he understands about Aufs. WELLPan knows that Aufs is very complicated.
