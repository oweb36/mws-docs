GiSY is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]]. He originally appeared in [[AACOS]].


## Identity

She is a wall-mounted Sharp AH-AP12GSY [air conditioner](Air%20Conditioners.md). Her name is pronounced Jee-See and her name is derived from the GSY portion of her species.

She was born in 2008. She is a pansexual demigirl (she/they).

If skin color mattered, she is white.

## Personality
GiSY is an optimist. She always looks to the bright side of life, no matter the conditions. This may be annoying to others who may be realists. GiSY is always trying to bring people's hopes and motivations up, even if they are not realistic. She just wants to make people happy you know that right?

GiSY also is a very kind and gentle demigirl. She's out there to care and nurture others. She may even try to teach and train her fellow friends on how to live, and survive. She also tries to nurture kindness, but that doesn't always works on some [sociopathic](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) people.

GiSY also can get hurt easily emotionally. She's very sensitive due to her nature. If she's hurt, then GiSY may recede and withdraw from society. Misunderstanding her is one way to hurt her.

GiSY is quite forgiving at least. She will forget any past harm, conflict and insults thrown to her or others. She forgives others and just wants to be friends. This can be against some of her peers, who are less forgiving much to their frustration.

## Relations

### [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG)

They are not exactly on good terms. DeltaCXG let's say bullies her a lot. DeltaCXG would also on not so rare occasions, actually physically harm GiSY, but [MXU](VXU.md#MXU) has intervened in all those occasions.

### [MHeLy](MHeLy.md)

They are good friends. MHeLy and GiSY's caring nature pairs them together. They would work together to not only care, but make the world a better place for everyone.

They are very happy together. They aren't a couple though. MHeLy is not a lesbian or LGBTQ in nature alright?
