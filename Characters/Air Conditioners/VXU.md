VXU is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]]. They originally appeared in [[AACOS]], an old part of old ObjecWeb36. This is because they are not just one person.

## Identity

VXU is actually a multi-system triplet composed of 3 mind/people that is also a single person:
- DeltaCXG (DCXG)
- CTUX
- MXU

MXU is Daikin 2MXU40GV1B. DeltaCXG is a wall-mounted Daikin CTXU42G2V1B, while CTUX is a wall-mounted Daikin CTXU50G2V1B. This is because VXU is a **Daikin Multi-Ururu Multi-Split system**. VXU is a [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md) system, as all their members (DeltaCXG, MXU and CTUX) are heat pumps. They are basically siblings, but also the same person.

CTUX was from AACOS while DeltaCXG was from an old part of old ObjecWeb36.

They are attached to a steel board with pipes and wires connecting them together, making them one. MXU is at the bottom, the legs of VXU, while DeltaCXG and CTUX is above MXU (CTUX is placed higher than DeltaCXG). MXU is the leg of VXU, while DeltaCXG and CTUX despite having legs, is instead the arms. DeltaCXG is one pair of arms, while CTUX is another pair of arms, so VXU has 4 arms in total.

MXU only has legs, but DeltaCXG and CTUX has both arms and legs. Its not that useful really as MXU is the legs of VXU, not DeltaCXG and CTUX.

Both MXU and CTUX were born in August 12, 2008. DeltaCXG is a later addition to them, as he was born in November 11, 2011. VXU is non-binary (they/them), but their individual members are all strictly cisgender and heterosexual male. The reason why VXU is non-binary, but MXU, CTUX and DeltaCXG is male is because VXU is not just one person, but three person as one person.

If skin color matters, VXU is white.

## Personality

Since VXU is a triad that is also a single person, each of the people in VXU has their own personalities. Each of them has contrasting personality that can balance each other out.

### DeltaCXG

DeltaCGX is the sociopathic, sadistic and uncaring saboteur. He cares for his siblings (AKA those who is part of VXU, including MXU), but doesn't care about others except for a select few.
## CTUX

CTUX is the overconfident and arrogant, but strong willed competitor, and is a good person in general. He is confident and determined. He can lead people with his great leadership skills, and is intelligent. He can strategically think.

CTUX's arrogance due to his confidence may lead him to underestimate others.

CTUX is not that sociopathic though. He would not willingly hurt others, unlike his fellow brother [DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG). He finds physical violence too far for him. CTUX would also try to stop DeltaCXG if he can, like [MXU](#MXU) is brother, but he is too powerless to do so (at least MXU is the one capable of that).

## MXU

MXU is the gentle one. He is not as brash as the others. MXU would even try to stop his fellow brothers, especially [DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG) from terrorizing others.

## Relations

### [Avxy](Avxy.md)

Avxy actually fears [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG). He knows that DeltaCXG would go too far in harming others. While Avxy only wants to get people's reactions, DeltaCXG would actually harm them, literally. 
### [GiSY](GiSY.md)

[DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG) is the one who likes to bully GiSY. He knows that GiSY is sensitive, and he still does it. He just wants to feel her pain. DeltaCXG wants to be a sadist towards this poor soul who just wants to make the world a better place.

A pesk- ```I mean helpful``` fellow sibling of VXU, [MXU](#MXU) is the reason why this bullying is not happening everyday. DeltaCXG would actually try to hurt GiSY, but MXU has been intervening in all of these cases, much to DeltaCGX's chargin and GiSY's ```help me pls idk the vocab pls```. MXU would intervene by walking away.

MXU is not always succesful in intervention though. DeltaCXG has hurt GiSY few times. DeltaCXG has said very nasty and demoralizing things to GiSY before MXU could intervene by walking away. 

DeltaCXG also has actually assaulted her succesfully, resulting in injuries to GiSY. Yeah, DeltaCXG actually hits demigirls, and is a women beater (probably). He punches her, which might be to rough on her at times.

### [RXe](RXe.md)

VXU has a complicated relationship with RXe as they are 3 people in one.  RXe likes [MXU](VXU.md#MXU), as he is chill. He has done nothign wrong to RXe, and neither does she.

RXe has a slight disdain with [CTUX](VXU.md#CTUX) cus of his arrogance at times. She doesn't think he deserves or even qualify to lead people. RXe thinks he is too full of himself.

The one person of VXU that RXe has a problem with is [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) as DeltaCXG would also hurt others. RXe sees DeltaCXG as competition.

### [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md)

DeltaCXG on several occasions has hit AngelSaph on the back of his head/body. This has resulted in his halo breaking on the impacted section. He does this to him way too often for safety's sake. DeltaCXG enjoys AngelSaph's pain, which is technically child abuse.

DeltaCXG is not interested in harming AngelSaph emotionally and making him in pain that way, but enjoys causing him physical pain. DeltaCXG on some of these occasions has hurt AngelSaph so hard that his body actually managed to crack a little bit, and bleed. 

[MXU](#MXU) has intervened on several of these incidents, with some being successful and some failing. AngelSaph sees MXU as his physical protector and actually likes him. He understands that MXU may not always be succesful. MXU always intervenes by walking away as thats the only thing he can do.

### [Wheamy](Wheamy.md)
Wheamy hates DeltaCXG for making not only his life hell, but burdens him in protecting others. DeltaCXG has harmed others, and potentially everyone. Wheamy doesn't need an extra abuser to deal with.
