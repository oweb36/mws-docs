VXU is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]]. They originally appeared in [[AACOS]], an old part of old ObjecWeb36. This is because they are not just one person.

## Identity

VXU is actually a multi-system triplet composed of 3 mind/people that is also a single person:
- DeltaCXG (DCXG)
- CTUX
- MXU

MXU is Daikin 2MXU40GV1B. DeltaCXG is a wall-mounted Daikin CTXU42G2V1B, while CTUX is a wall-mounted Daikin CTXU50G2V1B. This is because VXU is a **Daikin Multi-Ururu Multi-Split system**. VXU is a [heat pump](Air%20Conditioners.md) system, as all their members (DeltaCXG, MXU and CTUX) are heat pumps. They are basically siblings, but also the same person.

CTUX was from AACOS while DeltaCXG was from an old part of old ObjecWeb36.

They are attached to a steel board with pipes and wires connecting them together, making them one. MXU is at the bottom, the legs of VXU, while DeltaCXG and CTUX is above MXU (CTUX is placed higher than DeltaCXG). MXU is the leg of VXU, while DeltaCXG and CTUX despite having legs, is instead the arms. DeltaCXG is one pair of arms, while CTUX is another pair of arms, so VXU has 4 arms in total.

MXU only has legs, but DeltaCXG and CTUX has both arms and legs. Its not that useful really as MXU is the legs of VXU, not DeltaCXG and CTUX.

Both MXU and CTUX were born in August 12, 2008. DeltaCXG is a later addition to them, as he was born in November 11, 2011. VXU is non-binary (they/them), but their individual members are all strictly cisgender males. DeltaCXG is heterosexual while CTUX is bisexually heteroflexible and MXU is Asexual. The reason why VXU is non-binary, but MXU, CTUX and DeltaCXG is male is because VXU is not just one person, but three person as one person.

If skin color matters, VXU is white.

Whatever you do, don't try to disconnect a member of VXU from VXU. That's quite rude and it hurts to do so. An example is disconnecting [MXU](#MXU) from [DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG) by ripping DeltaCXG off or disconnecting their cables. It would hurt [CTUX](#CTUX) too.

## Personality

Since VXU is a triad that is also a single person, each of the people in VXU has their own personalities. Each of them has contrasting personality that can balance each other out.

### DeltaCXG
TLDR: Psychopathic, sadist and uncaring saboteur. Cares for a few (MXU, CTUX), but still bullies them (especially the latter). Empathy-lacking, enjoys people suffering. Noticeably targets girls more than boys. Not good.

DeltaCGX is the ~~sociopathic~~ psychopathic, sadistic and uncaring saboteur. He cares for his siblings (AKA those who is part of VXU, including MXU), but doesn't care about others except for a select few. Despite this, he still bullies [MXU](#MXU) because MXU is too kind.

He not only lacks empathy, he also enjoys watching other people suffer. Though not discriminatory, he noticeably targets girls more than the boys.

DeltaCXG is the bad person here. Well, it's more like he has a personality disorder, but that does not excuse what he does.
## CTUX

TLDR: Strong willed, overconfident and arrogant-ass guy. Great at leadership and strategic thinking, but whatevs. Known to underestimate people at times. He can be humble though at times. Not that ~~sociopathic~~ psychopathic unlike [DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG). He would not willingly hurt others unlike DeltaCXG, and violence is too far. Would like to stop this psychopath, but CTUX does not have the power to do so unlike [MXU](#MXU) and would like to protect others. Is good.

CTUX is the overconfident and arrogant, but strong willed competitor, and is a good person in general. He is confident and determined. He can lead people with his great leadership skills, and is intelligent. He can strategically think.

CTUX's arrogance due to his confidence may lead him to underestimate others. Although his arrogance manifests quite often, at times he is humble

CTUX is not that psychopathic ~~sociopathic~~ though. He would not willingly hurt others, unlike his fellow brother [DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG). He finds physical violence too far for him. CTUX would also try to stop DeltaCXG if he can, like [MXU](#MXU) is brother, but he is too powerless to do so (at least MXU is the one capable of that). If he has power, CTUX would protect others.

CTUX inherently is not a bad person, but genuinely a good person. He is just too arrogant and leadership-oriented for this good side to manifest frequently.

## MXU

TLDR: Gentle. Not brash, and would stop [this ~~sociopath~~ psychopath](#DeltaCXG) from terrorizing and hurting others. Snap-ass. And is good, and has power unlike [CTUX](VXU.md) bruh.

MXU is the gentle one. He is not as brash as the others. MXU would even try to stop his fellow brothers, especially [DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG) from terrorizing others.

Can be assertive at times, especially with DeltaCXG. May also be quite snappy, but yeah that is him.

MXU is a good person definitely. He has power, but is armless.

## Relations

### [Avxy](Avxy.md)

Avxy actually fears [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG). He knows that DeltaCXG would go too far in harming others. While Avxy only wants to get people's reactions, DeltaCXG would actually harm them, literally. 
### [GiSY](GiSY.md)

[DeltaCXG](#DeltaCXG) is the one who likes to bully GiSY. He knows that GiSY is sensitive, and he still does it. He just wants to feel her pain. DeltaCXG wants to be a sadist towards this poor soul who just wants to make the world a better place.

A pesk- ```I mean helpful``` fellow sibling of VXU, [MXU](#MXU) is the reason why this bullying is not happening everyday. DeltaCXG would actually try to hurt GiSY, but MXU has been intervening in all of these cases, much to DeltaCGX's chargin and GiSY's ```help me pls idk the vocab pls```. MXU would intervene by walking away.

MXU is not always succesful in intervention though. DeltaCXG has hurt GiSY few times. DeltaCXG has said very nasty and demoralizing things to GiSY before MXU could intervene by walking away. 

DeltaCXG also has actually assaulted her succesfully, resulting in injuries to GiSY. He once punched and struck her so hard, he managed to crack her body. Yeah, DeltaCXG actually hits demigirls, and is a women beater (probably). Not that it matters though.

### [RXe](RXe.md)

VXU has a complicated relationship with RXe as they are 3 people in one.  RXe likes [MXU](VXU.md#MXU), as he is chill. He has done nothign wrong to RXe, and neither does she.

RXe has a slight disdain with [CTUX](VXU.md#CTUX) cus of his arrogance at times. She doesn't think he deserves or even qualify to lead people. RXe thinks he is too full of himself.

The one person of VXU that RXe has a problem with is [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) as DeltaCXG would also hurt others. RXe sees DeltaCXG as competition.

### [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md)

DeltaCXG on several occasions has hit AngelSaph on the back of his head/body. This has resulted in his halo breaking on the impacted section. He does this to him way too often for safety's sake. DeltaCXG enjoys AngelSaph's pain, which is technically child abuse.

DeltaCXG is not interested in harming AngelSaph emotionally and making him in pain that way, but enjoys causing him physical pain. DeltaCXG on some of these occasions has hurt AngelSaph so hard that his body actually managed to crack pretty badly, and bleed. 

[MXU](#MXU) has intervened on several of these incidents, with some being successful and some failing. AngelSaph sees MXU as his physical protector and actually likes him. He understands that MXU may not always be succesful. MXU always intervenes by walking away as thats the only thing he can do.

### [Wheamy](Wheamy.md)
Wheamy hates DeltaCXG for making not only his life hell, but burdens him in protecting others. DeltaCXG has harmed others, and potentially everyone. Wheamy doesn't need an extra abuser to deal with.

### [JVXH](JVXH.md)
JVXH fears DeltaCXG. She knows the weird things DeltaCXG would do. She has seen the horrors of DeltaCXG.

DeltaCXG wouldn't do anything to JVXH. Even though he knows that JVXH fears him, he doesn't care about her that much. DeltaCXG knows what JVXH would do.

### [MHeLy](MHeLy.md)
MHeLy is very accepting of DeltaCXG despite knowing the danger. MHeLy is one of the few people to actually have the balls to approach DeltaCXG.

### [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md)
VXU has two sides: Fear and concern.

[MXU](VXU.md#MXU) is quite concerned and fearful about ToshyFEN. MXU is concerned about his mental wellbeing, as you know ToshyFEN has some of the worst mental health states in MWS. He is also feareful because he knows that ToshyFEN can do some unhinged shit.

[CTUX](VXU.md#CTUX) has less concern and less fear compared to MXU, but he still has those feelings. He is less concerned because he feels that he can take on him if needed, but he won't for the most part.

[DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) has no concern, but more fear. DeltaCXG has no concern about his mental health, and why would he? DeltaCXG is this sociopath who doesn't care about others. He is willing to bully them for fun.  
DeltaCXG is also fearful of ToshyFEN because his mental health is not good and he can do unhinged shit again. DeltaCXG fears what ToshyFEN is capable of. Even with that, DeltaCXG would still try to bully this guy. DeltaCXG knows that ToshyFEN is one of the few people capable of stopping him.

So, MXU and CTUX are concerned and rather not get in trouble with ToshyFEN. DeltaCXg on the other hand, though knows the danger of ToshyFEN would still try to make some trouble with him.

#### [AEX](AEX.md)
HR has a love-hate relationship with VXU.

HR respects [MXU](VXU.md#MXU) for attempting to stop [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG) if he can. HR though feels at times MXU is incompetent or even slacking off at this responsibility.

HR has problems with DeltaCXG. He does not like DeltaCXG bullying and harming others. HR would rip DeltaCXG if he dares hurt [PCR](#PCR). HR is also that one guy along with ToshyFEN to stop DeltaCXG if needed.
