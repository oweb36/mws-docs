## Personality
She's practical. She is also down to basic, down to earth, and she just put things as it is. No sugarcoating from her, expect brutal opinions and truth from her.

Fisios, despite being practical may be progressive. She may optimize work, in any way she can. While others might be straightforward, Fisios will take advantage of and exploit any shortcuts she can find.

### [KaHLium](KaHLium.md)
They both are aware that they are down to the basics, down to earth and practical. They talk like a normal conversation.

No funny things, but they are efficient when paired together. Due to them being down to basic and practical, they have an extremely high efficiency of work rate in doing work. They do the work and then immediately move on after doing everything needed for the work. No extra work, or incomplete work by them.
