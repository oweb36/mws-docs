Wheamy is a [character](Characters.md) as a contestant on the [Megarchive Warehouse Show](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md).

## Identity
Wheamy is an LG WM2101HW [washing machine](Washing%20Machines.md). His name is pronounced as Whim-my.

He was born on December 19, 2009. He is a cisgender and pansexual male (he/him).

## Personality
Wheamy is pretty much caring towards others, and what they need. He usually protects others, typically those younger than him. He may doubt himself though at times, in his abilities to protect or whether he is doing it for real.

Wheamy may also not always be the happiest person. He may lash out at times. This is due to him protecting his dependees from the danger. This danger is what makes him not the happiest, as he hates them to his core.

## Relations
### [Idendiby](Idendiby.md)
Wheamy is the guardian for Idendiby. Idendiby is very young, and Wheamy is there to protect him.

### [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md)
Wheamy protects AngelSaph not only because of his young age, but also due to his emotional and physical vulnerability.

### [DeltaCXG](VXU.md#DeltaCXG)
Wheamy hates him for making not only his life hell, but burdens him in protecting others. DeltaCXG has harmed others, and potentially everyone. Wheamy doesn't need an extra abuser to deal with.

### [RXe](RXe.md)
Wheamy hates the shit out of RXe. He has to deal with many potential abusers to his dependees. He doesn't need more!

### [Piss](Piss.md)
Wheamy does not inherently hate or dislike him, but is not the happiest with him. Their relations aren't the most harmonious.

Why? Because Piss tries to prevent AngelSaph from eating for safekeeping. While Wheamy understands that Piss is doing it for the good of everyone, he can't just do that while allowing one person who needs food to die!
