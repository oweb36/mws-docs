He is a bisexual demiboy (he/them).\n\nIf skin color matters, ToshySMUT is white.\n\n## Personality\n\nHe is rude and smutty, but not bad. He just doesn't know how to express himself nicely. He is just a poor misunderstood soul, who is trying to be nice but people take him as a rude person.\n\nToshySMUT appears as rude as he would interrupt people randomly, and say not so nice stuff about others. He would sometimes drop bombshell truths about others when its not appropriate. This is why people see him as a smut.\n\nToshySMUT is a good person though. Its just that he doesn't know how to express himself nicely, and in fact he also doesn't know how to properly socialize. He is too isolated for it. If he is not rude, he can tell you stories from his heart and his struggles.\n\n## Relations\n\n#airconditioner ", "Raiie.md": "\nRaiie is a [character](Characters) as a contestant on the [[Megarchive Warehouse Show]].

He is a cisgender and heterosexual male.  \nIf skin color matters, Aurl is white.\n\n## Personality\n\nHe is both positive and negative. He is normally calm, but no one can beat the chillness of [[WELLPan]].\n\nHe normally is unfazed and unbothered, or that is what he looks like on the surface. He is quite observant on his surrounding, allowing him to gather intel on others, and their browsing history. He is slightly disappointed with what they had looked up, but its not that major nasty.\n\nThis intelligence allows him to execute cunning plans and outsmart others. He also has a volatile temper, that can get really nasty at times. If he's angered, he is unpredictable! He might even start a school shooting all of a sudden!\n\nInside him, there is a dark part of him that wants him to hurt others. That dark part of him is sadism, and it manifests during his temper outbreak.\n\n## Relations\n\n### [WELLPan](WELLPan.md)\n\nThey are frenemies, but they are more of a friend that enemies. The only conflict that they can be in is in a friendly little competition of who can be the chillest, and WELLPan always wins.

He is wise, but less knowledgable compared to [CKHSC](CKHSC.md) (who knows about more things than ASTAC). ASTAC is also like a grandfather figure to the MVS cast.\n\nASTAC has one starking difference compared to CKHSC, in that he is less stubborn and more open to new things. He likes trying out new things and compare them to the old days. He is very experimental.\n\nASTAC is also quite cautious at new things though, but he is quite accepting. He is cautious so he can be ready if the new thing turns out to be harmful.\n\n\n## Relations\n\n### [CKHSC](CKHSC.md)\n\nThey are friends, but have a friendly rivalry.

ToshyFEN is also heavy.\n\nIf skin color matters, ToshyFEN is white.\n\n## Personality\n\nHe basically has two personalities that are volatile at changing about.\n\nHe has this one personality where he is really chill, and likes to chat. He can never be as chill as [WELLPan](WELLPan.md), but he is chill. He just listens, and talk a little. He likes small talk, and big talk. He is just there for WELLPan mostly, but can be there for others. Basically he just does nothing except listen and yap.\n\nThen he has this other personality where he is straight up unhinged, crazy, insane, angry and violent. He commits harms to those who caused him this, and a bit of others. He isn't a sadist, but he is crazy. He literally chases others to no end with this.
