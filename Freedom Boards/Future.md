## Future Ideas

- [ ] [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md) is now fully grown and tall. 
	
	He now also has a ring that floats with him, that allows him to see from the back. It has eyes at the back. This ring is made of the same material as his halo.
	
	This ring only appears he is good, both in physical, mental and emotional state. It dissapears when one of them is deterioriating.
	
	AngelSaph would also obtain wings. Metalic wings.
- [ ] [GiSY](GiSY.md) would become taller. She would also become a partial angel like [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md). Like AngelSaph, she would later also have some of her body partially become flesh the AngelSaph way. So she would later become an enchanced cyborg being.
	
	Her halo would behave like AngelSaph, except the emotional indications because she is more noticable about her mental and emotional health unlike AngelSaph. Her halo is unique though, as its made of 18K rose gold, giving her halo a unique look. Her halo also looks like a lower-grade-quality version of [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md)'s halo. Its as if her halo has been broken and then someone poorly rewelded bits of her halo again.
	
	GiSY and AngelSaph serves different purposes niches, but they can and do work together to do more.
- [ ] [Xeo](Xeo.md) would be taller, and be damaged (cracks and slight inward bent as scars, she is still ok though dw about her as she still works). She would have controlled some of her anger issues, but she still has some of the anger issues left (Its her now).
