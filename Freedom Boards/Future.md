## Future Ideas

- [ ] [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md) is now fully grown and tall. 
	
	He now also has a ring that floats with him, that allows him to see from the back. It has eyes at the back. This ring is made of the same material as his halo.
	
	This ring only appears he is good, both in physical, mental and emotional state. It dissapears when one of them is deterioriating.
	
	AngelSaph would also obtain wings. Metalic wings. He can fly.
	
	His halo would also be harder, so its harder to damage. Now you can't just hit him and expect it to break, but his back is still his achilles' heel.
- [ ] [GiSY](GiSY.md) would become taller. She would also become a partial angel like [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md). Like AngelSaph, she would later also have some of her body partially become flesh the AngelSaph way. So she would later become an enchanced cyborg being.
	
	Her halo would behave like AngelSaph, except the emotional indications because she is more noticable about her mental and emotional health unlike AngelSaph. Her halo is unique though, as its made of 18K rose gold, giving her halo a unique look. Her halo also looks like a lower-grade-quality version of [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md)'s halo. Its as if her halo has been broken and then someone poorly rewelded bits of her halo again.
	
	GiSY and AngelSaph serves different purposes niches, but they can and do work together to do more.
- [ ] [Xeo](Xeo.md) would be taller, and be damaged (cracks and slight inward bent as scars, she is still ok though dw about her as she still works). She would have controlled some of her anger issues, but she still has some of the anger issues left (Its her now).
- [ ] [MHeLy](MHeLy.md) would have a massive overhaul in identity and appearance, probably.
	
	## Appearance and physiology
	She is way taller than currently. Way taller.
	
	
	### Not so subtle cosmetic flashiness
	MHeLy would have cosmetic differences. She have hair now? Yeah! She also has two eyelashes, which are accentuated with mascara. MHeLy would also obtain an Outdoor Unit, at the back of her. She would have a rose on her front body at the top right, and a hairpin at the back of her hair. Yes.
	
	She also wears high top shoes, cus she is overhauled.
	
	
	### Injuries
	One thing with MHeLy is that she would have scars and permanent injuries. Don't worry, she won't be crippled, she has her ways.
	
	Lets say, she broke her right wrist and ankle, permanently. Like the bones are literally shattered, with the destruction of the ligaments. She wears ankle support and wrist support so she can still use them, otherwise the destroyed bone and joints won't allow her.
	
	MHeLy ain't subtle about this, her high top shoes may also be there to hide the ankle support, but she still shows it. She does use drawing gloves for her right hand as a cover for her wrist support.
	
	### Body
	With the help of [AngelSaph](AngelSaph.md), MHeLy also have part of flesh in her body. She is also now part flesh and part body. She now has true free-will, and will need to eat and drink. She now understands AngelSaph.
	
	With this new fleshiness, MHeLy can truly regenerate. It doesn't help with her destroyed bones and ligaments at her right ankle and wrist, as they were destroyed before she became this flesh-electronic cyborg being.
	
	
	## Personality
	She is more competitive, slightmy more aggressive and less pacifist. She would do violence there and then, but is still nice.
	
	She is still nice and kind, but not that nice as before.
