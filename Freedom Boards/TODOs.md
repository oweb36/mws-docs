## Eternity

- [ ] Give [JHR](JHR.md) siblings and cousins. Then assimilate JHR into a person-lith kinda like [VXU](VXU.md) with his siblings as he and his siblings are capable of multi-split unit operation.
	
	His siblings are a Sharp AE-XM30GR, AY-XPC7JR and AY-XPM18HR. 
	
	This monolith person-lith is called as "AEX" (ax).
- [ ] Give JHR or AEX a cousin. AEX/JHR's cousin is the IVT version of JHR (superior and inferior at the same time).


## Backlog

- [ ] Complete [Episode 1](EP1.md).


## Todo

- [ ] Awux -> Awu-See
	
	Fujitsu AWU18CXQ. Female.
- [ ] Aufs -> A-U-F-S (Ay-You-Eff-Es)
	
	Fujitsu AUG54FUAS cassette.
	
	Aufs is demigender-demifluid. He is agenderous in one half, while he is genderfluid in his other half. We can say that he is demifluid. Practically, he is demifluid, but Aufs also likes to be refered to as demiagender. Aufs is basically Demifluid agender at this point.
	
	His agender side, is neutral and genderless. This agender side, basically identifies as Aufs. So Aufs half identifies as Aufs himself.
	
	His genderfluid side is non-binary. Yeah. It can change though, but mostly likes it to be Non-Binary cus he has no idea what to be.
	
	Aufs is basically half-Aufs and half-NB.
	
	Aufs likes to use the pronouns he/them.
	
	Aufs is toric, he likes men. This is why he has the "he" in his pronouns.


## Current

- [ ] Xefa
	
	Panasonic CS-XE12EKE. Female.

## Done

**Complete**
- [x] Add a new smug character named Avxy, which is a Sharp AIOT air conditioner. He is a smug little shit, a cocky little shit.
- [x] Xeo, female (she/her).
	
	Panasonic CS-XE21MKEW from 2010. Superior version of [JKE](JKE.md).
	
	The catty, bitchy and passive aggressive kind. She doesn't harm physically (mostly), but is quite hostile. 
	
	Her physicall attacks mostly goes as catfighting. She might get a (potentially brutal) physical beatdown from others though, as she won't fight back. Coward.
	
	She is also quite angry as a person, its rare to see her in a good mood. Unlike the others such as [Aurl](Aurl.md) and [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md), she is never calm, she is always angery. She has unresolved anger issues.
	
	Xeo is indeed the ratfucker bitch. She is not a good person definitely.
- [ ] Add Angelsaph, a Gree Saphire air conditioner. He has a golden-white shiny halo made of solid gold-titanium-platinum-aluminium alloy. This halo is part of his body and can act as a protection. It can regenerate slowly if its damaged.
	
	While others are pure electronic inorganic, AngelSaph has some flesh inside of him.
