## Eternity

- [ ] GIve [JHR](JHR.md) siblings and cousins. Then assimilate JHR into a person-lith kinda like [VXU](VXU.md) with his siblings as he and his siblings are capable of multi-split unit operation.
	
	His siblings are a Sharp AE-XM30GR, AY-XPC7JR and AY-XPM18HR.
	
	JHR's cousin is his IVT version (superior and inferior at the same time).


## Backlog



## Todo

- [ ] Xefa
	
	Panasonic CS-XE12EKE. Female.
	
	Valley girl in a nutshell.


## Current



## Done

**Complete**
- [x] Add a new smug character named Avxy, which is a Sharp AIOT air conditioner. He is a smug little shit, a cocky little shit.
- [x] Xeo, female (she/her).
	
	Panasonic CS-XE21MKEW from 2010. Superior version of [JKE](JKE.md).
	
	The catty, bitchy and passive aggressive kind. She doesn't harm physically (mostly), but is quite hostile. 
	
	Her physicall attacks mostly goes as catfighting. She might get a (potentially brutal) physical beatdown from others though, as she won't fight back. Coward.
	
	She is also quite angry as a person, its rare to see her in a good mood. Unlike the others such as [Aurl](Aurl.md) and [ToshyFEN](ToshyFEN.md), she is never calm, she is always angery. She has unresolved anger issues.
	
	Xeo is indeed the ratfucker bitch. She is not a good person definitely.
- [ ] Add Angelsaph, a Gree Saphire air conditioner. He has a golden-white shiny halo made of solid gold-titanium-platinum-aluminium alloy. This halo is part of his body and can act as a protection. It can regenerate slowly if its damaged.
	
	While others are pure electronic inorganic, AngelSaph has some flesh inside of him.
