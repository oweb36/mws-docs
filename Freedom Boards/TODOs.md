	And also make groups, alliance, cliques and all that crap.
- [ ] Give [Termyice](Termyice.md) and [LCN](LCN.md) life as the first LG people.
- [ ] [REU](REU.md) personality time.


## Current

- [ ] Rewrite personalities while staying consistent.
	
	Rewrite by studying them, breaking them apart into traits and rewrite them.


## Done

**Complete**
- [x] NEptha
	
	Panasonic CS-NE12LKE.
	Male.
- [x] Awux -> Awu-See
	
	Fujitsu AWU18CXQ. Female.
- [x] Aufs -> A-U-F-S (Ay-You-Eff-Es)
	
	Fujitsu AUY36AGB3W cassette. His name is because his old species (development) was the Fujitsu AUG54FUAS cassette, but its too good so its kept.
	
	Aufs is demigender-demifluid. He is agenderous in one half, while he is genderfluid in his other half. We can say that he is demifluid. Practically, he is demifluid, but Aufs also likes to be refered to as demiagender. Aufs is basically Demifluid agender at this point.
	
	His agender side, is neutral and genderless. This agender side, basically identifies as Aufs. So Aufs half identifies as Aufs himself.
	
	His genderfluid side is non-binary. Yeah. It can change though, but mostly likes it to be Non-Binary cus he has no idea what to be.
	
	Aufs is basically half-Aufs and half-NB.
	
	Aufs likes to use the pronouns he/them.
	
	Aufs is toric, he likes men. This is why he has the "he" in his pronouns.
- [x] Give [JHR](AEX.md#JHR) siblings and cousins. Then assimilate JHR into a person-lith kinda like [VXU](VXU.md) with his siblings as he and his siblings are capable of multi-split unit operation.
	
	His siblings are a Sharp AE-XM30GR, AY-XPC7JR and AY-XPM18HR. 
	
	This monolith person-lith is called as "AEX" (Pronounced as Ax or Axe). JHR is still called JHR. AY-XPM18HR's name is HR, AE-XM30GR is EXMGR (Pronounced as E-X-M-G-R or E-X-Manager) and AY-XPC7JR is PCR (Pronounced as P-C-R).
	
	In AEX, PCR is the only female. AEX is now therefore a bigender (he/she) because there's a female and males. AEX is also non-binary (they/them) because AEX is now 4 person in 1 person. You can now refer to AEX as he/she/they/them.
