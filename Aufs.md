### Gender Identity
Aufs's gender is Demigender. Its pretty complicated, because Aufs is well, a demiagender and a demifluid demigender person. His pronouns are he/them.

He is demiagender, which means he is half agender. This agender side is unique. His agender side is not binary, and not even non-binary. His agender side is not even genderfluid. His agender side is well, Aufs. Aufs partly identifies as Aufs. This Aufs gender identity is why he identifies as *them*. Aufs is his agender side. Aufs being demiagender means he is demiaufs from what we see.

His demifluid side is well genderfluid. This means that Aufs is half-agenderous-Aufs and half-genderfluid. His genderfluid side is non-binary because he has no idea on what to be. He doesn't know what, he is not male or female. So Aufs is half-agenderous-Aufs and half-genderfluid-non-binary.

Its pretty complicated. Aufs is half-agenderous-Aufs and half-genderfluid-non-binary. Aufs is demiAufs and deminonbinary practically if we see the final layers. So yeah, its complicated. Aufs identifies as Aufs and non-binary technically, but in reality is demiagender and demifluid. This is why he has *them* as his pronouns.

With his sexual orientation, its easy. Aufs is toric, which means he likes males, or **MAN**. This is why he also has *he* as his pronouns.
