Metatheatrics is an ability in [MWS](Megarchive%20Warehouse%20Show.md). Its an ability to be aware of the show itself. Metatheatrics gives wielders the ability to be aware of their existence, their nature and the show where they exists. 

Whoever has the power is also aware of the 4th wall, the camera, and the audience due to their metatheatrical abilities. This means they can break the 4th wall. People though get confused when they see the wielders of metatheatrics talking to *"nobody"* (that *"nobody"* is the camera and audience).

Wielders is also aware of retcons. They knows retroactive continuity, and knows when it happened. They might be able to circumvent retcons by telling retcon victims what happened before. People typically see people using this abilities as lunatics because who would believe such a  thing (which is ridiculous from their POV).

The wielders though is not immune to retcons targeted against themselves. The holders of the power would be too OP if they is immune to retcons targeted against them.

There's one awesome thing wielders can do with metatheatrics. The wielders can take advantage of the camera to teleport. They just need to move out of frame, and then once the camera has moved go out of frame and **TADA**. One disadvantage with this method is that the power holders don't have any control of their destination as they are at the mercy of the camera.
